  This page in a nutshell: Because of the limited amount of space, and due to the fact that any given day of the year can have a great many moderate to great historically significant events, relative article quality along with the mix of topics already listed are often deciding factors in what gets posted on the "On this day" section on the Main Page. It is NOT solely based on what are "the most important or significant" anniversaries on this day.

  This set of pages serves as a queue of selected anniversaries in history taken from each day of the year's events and holidays/observances section and from current Jewish, Islamic, and other lunar-based calendars. The selected anniversaries queue is used to help facilitate and coordinate updates to the "On this day" section on the Main Page.
- |
  To prevent highly visible vandalism, each page in this queue is protected from editing while it appears on the Main Page. Otherwise, they are freely editable throughout most of the year.

  How to make suggestions for listings[edit]
- |
  Be bold while improving this queue but please make sure you follow the guidelines. Important: although anniversary listings on individual date articles are written in the present tense, "selected anniversary listings" should be in the past tense, to help distinguish them from current events when displayed on the Main Page.
- |
  If you want to add an item to yesterday's, today's, or tomorrow's listings, you need to be an administrator because those templates are protected. If you're not, add them to the talk page, such as Wikipedia talk:Selected anniversaries/December 14.
- |
  For unprotected days, go ahead and add them directly to the page, such as Wikipedia:Selected anniversaries/December 16. If you replace a visible one, be sure you return the one you removed to the staging area collapsible box.
- |
  If you're not sure what to do or how to best phrase the blurb, make your suggestion on the day's talk page.

  Criteria for listing items on this set of pages[edit]
- |2+

- |
  The criteria for inclusion in the selected anniversaries queue are rather subjective due to the fact that any given day of the year can have a great many historical events worthy of listing. So relative article quality along with the mix of topics already listed are often deciding factors. Criteria for inclusion:
- |
  Generally 5 events can be displayed each day. This number may vary slightly depending on the length of the Wikipedia:Today's featured article and Wikipedia:Did you know sections so that the left and right columns appear balanced without too much empty space. Preference is given to anniversaries celebrating a significant anniversary. For events 100 years old and up, that means multiples of 25 (e.g., 200th, 325th, 550th, etc). If it's less than 100 years old, that means in multiples of 25 or 10 (e.g., 75th, 60th, 30th).
- |
  Holidays/observances should be limited to a maximum of 3, but this may also increase to accommodate those that do not appear on the same date each year. Holidays should be listed in this order: international observances (secular followed by religious) first (except those that are not serious in nature, e.g., International Talk Like a Pirate Day—these should appear at the end of the list), then alphabetically by country where observed. When the same day is observed in multiple countries (but not worldwide), then the countries should be listed alphabetically, and the first country used for sorting.
- |
  The event needs to be of moderate to great historical significance (relative to the other historical events that occurred on the same day of the year). It should also be the most, or one of the most, important events associated with the selected article. Finally, the event should have occurred on the day in question (according to the Gregorian calendar) in local time, or UTC if local time is not applicable (e.g., not on Earth).
- |
  The event and the selected article (bolded item) needs to be listed in the Events section of its corresponding day-of-the-year article, and therefore should also comply with the criteria for inclusion listed on Wikipedia:Days of the year.
- |
  If the holiday or observance occurs on the same day each Gregorian year, it needs to be in the Holidays/Observances section on the corresponding day-of-the-year article. Non Gregorian-based holidays, whose date of observance varies from year-to-year, do not have to be listed on the day-of-the-year articles, but should still comply with the rest of WP:DOY#Holidays and observances.
- |
  The historical event needs to be important enough to be included in the selected article (bolded item).
- |
  The selected article needs to be updated to clearly state the event or day of the celebration/observance, as well as the exact day it occurred/occurs. Non-Gregorian-based holidays and observances need not state the exact day since this will differ each year. The date must be a cited to a reliable source with an inline citation, since inline citations are used to support specific statements in an article.
- |
  The selected article (bolded item) must not be a stub and preferably it should be a relatively complete and well-formatted article, free from 'yellow'-level or more severe article issue tags. In other words, it should be a good example of Wikipedia content (see also Wikipedia:FAQ/Main Page#I think that the articles listed on the Main Page are awful. Isn't the Main Page biased towards certain topics? What can be done about it?). Conversely, preference is not given to featured articles or even good articles. All articles that meet the minimum standard should be given the same weight.
- |
  As much as possible, the array of topics should include a variety of years (e.g., not just limited to the 20th century), geographical areas (e.g., more than just the Anglosphere), and subjects (e.g., not too many articles on war or technology).
- |
  Births and natural deaths of notable people can be used only on centennials. Unnatural deaths (assassinations, accidents, etc) of notable figures may be used at any time.
- |
  Ideally, any particular selected article should only be listed (be an emboldened entry) once in this queue. To help make sure articles are not selected (emboldened item) more than once, check the article's links and examine all the pages listed that begin with Wikipedia:Selected anniversaries/. There is no limit to the number of times an article can be incidentally linked in the queue (this includes all the non-bolded links). Exceptions are made for holidays/observances, as the same holiday may be celebrated on different dates in different countries, and country articles, as they may be the emboldened entry for holidays such as Independence Day if the nation's observance doesn't have its own article.
- |
  So, a combination of the "majorness" of the event, the mix of items already listed, and the relative completeness of the article, are the criteria used, along with the requirement for appropriate "context" and minimal compliance with Wikipedia:Days of the year.
- |
  Lastly, entries are written in the past tense, preferably in a single sentence.
- |
  Criteria for listing images in day entries[edit]
- |
  Only one image should be displayed for any particular day entry at any one time. The image, however, can be switched throughout the day.
- |
  The image should be no more than 100px wide and 100px high. Because the image is so small, the subject should be easily distinguished at that size. Judicious cropping may also be employed to highlight a specific aspect of the image (see {{m-cropped}}).
- |
  For design purposes, if there is choice between an image of a person facing left and a person facing right, pick the face-left one–it draws the reader's attention toward the associated text, rather than away from it.
- |
  Only free images (PD, GFDL, CC etc.) can appear on the Main Page. Non-free images are not permitted.
- |
  Image code: {{main page image|File:Example.svg|This is an example}} (see Template:Main page image for complete documentation).
- |
  Staging area[edit]
- |
  A list of other available events and images can be viewed at the specific subpage in the "staging area" (the staging area is not visible when transcluded onto another page thanks to <noinclude></noinclude> tags). Some of these items (the "Eligible" section) can be used as backups that can be rotated in and out from year to year. Other items are listed as "Ineligible" because they no longer pass the selected anniversaries criteria (see above), and thus need to be cleaned up.
- |
  Admins: When removing items from these pages while they are on the Main Page, please consider moving them into the "staging area" instead of outright deleting them so they can prospectively be used again in the future.
- |
  Also, to maintain some variety of topics on the Main Page as a whole, an event should be hidden if it is also the featured article or the featured picture for that particular day.
- |
  Maintenance guidelines[edit]
- |
  Because each of the selected anniversaries pages rotate onto the Main Page every year, they will each need annual maintenance before they appear there:
- |
  Non-Gregorian-based holidays and observances should be moved to the correct day for the current year. When moved, they should not count towards the maximum "3 holidays/observances per day" limit since a number of them might suddenly fall on the same day during a particular year.[1][2] These holidays and observances should also be marked with the current year in parentheses as a reminder to others that their dates do in fact vary from year to year.
- |
  In general, National Days, Independence Days, and other holidays celebrating the nationhood of a country should be marked by the year of the significant historic date being observed. An exception can be made when non-Gregorian-based holidays also fall within the same day, and the non-consistent use of dates might confuse new users.[1]
- |
  Each emboldened article should be checked to make sure they still qualify under the selected anniversaries criteria. For those that do not, there are two options: An alternate emboldened article can be selected for the same event if one exists, especially if the original emboldened article was merged or split. Otherwise, it should be moved to the staging area, clearly marked that it needs cleanup.
- |
  Make sure to double check, copyedit, and verify each event on the selected anniversaries page so it is consistent with the facts presented in the emboldened article, since they may have changed since the previous year.
- |
  After your changes, please edit the talk page to indicate what changes were made, following the examples that are already there.

- '} );This set of pages serves as a queue of selected anniversaries in history taken
  from each day of the year''s events and holidays/observances section and from current
  Jewish, Islamic, and other lunar-based calendars. The selected anniversaries queue
  is used to help facilitate and coordinate updates to the "On this day" section on
  the Main Page.To prevent highly visible vandalism, each page in this queue is protected
  from editing while it appears on the Main Page. Otherwise, they are freely editable
  throughout most of the year.December 14: Day of the Martyred Intellectuals in Bangladesh
  (1971); Monkey DayBe bold while improving this queue but please make sure you follow
  the guidelines. Important: although anniversary listings on individual date articles
  are written in the present tense, "selected anniversary listings" should be in the
  past tense, to help distinguish them from current events when displayed on the Main
  Page.The criteria for inclusion in the selected anniversaries queue are rather subjective
  due to the fact that any given day of the year can have a great many historical
  events worthy of listing. So relative article quality along with the mix of topics
  already listed are often deciding factors. Criteria for inclusion:Ideally, any particular
  selected article should only be listed (be an emboldened entry) once in this queue.
  To help make sure articles are not selected (emboldened item) more than once, check
  the article''s links and examine all the pages listed that begin with Wikipedia:Selected
  anniversaries/. There is no limit to the number of times an article can be incidentally
  linked in the queue (this includes all the non-bolded links). Exceptions are made
  for holidays/observances, as the same holiday may be celebrated on different dates
  in different countries, and country articles, as they may be the emboldened entry
  for holidays such as Independence Day if the nation''s observance doesn''t have
  its own article.So, a combination of the "majorness" of the event, the mix of items
  already listed, and the relative completeness of the article, are the criteria used,
  along with the requirement for appropriate "context" and minimal compliance with
  Wikipedia:Days of the year.Lastly, entries are written in the past tense, preferably
  in a single sentence.Image code: {{main page image|File:Example.svg|This is an example}}
  (see Template:Main page image for complete documentation).A list of other available
  events and images can be viewed at the specific subpage in the "staging area" (the
  staging area is not visible when transcluded onto another page thanks to <noinclude></noinclude>
  tags). Some of these items (the "Eligible" section) can be used as backups that
  can be rotated in and out from year to year. Other items are listed as "Ineligible"
  because they no longer pass the selected anniversaries criteria (see above), and
  thus need to be cleaned up.Admins: When removing items from these pages while they
  are on the Main Page, please consider moving them into the "staging area" instead
  of outright deleting them so they can prospectively be used again in the future.Also,
  to maintain some variety of topics on the Main Page as a whole, an event should
  be hidden if it is also the featured article or the featured picture for that particular
  day.Because each of the selected anniversaries pages rotate onto the Main Page every
  year, they will each need annual maintenance before they appear there:Selected anniversaries/On

  or Wikipedia:Stress alerts.\n\nThis page in a nutshell: Because of the limited amount
  of space, and due to the fact that any given day of the year can have a great many
  moderate to great historically significant events, relative article quality along
  with the mix of topics already listed are often deciding factors in what gets posted
  on the \"On this day\" section on the Main Page. It is NOT solely based on what
  are \"the most important or significant\" anniversaries on this day.\n\nShortcuts:\nWP:SA\nWP:OTD\n\nThis
  set of pages serves as a queue of selected anniversaries in history taken from each
  day of the year's events and holidays/observances section and from current Jewish,
  Islamic, and other lunar-based calendars. The selected anniversaries queue is used
  to help facilitate and coordinate updates to the \"On this day\" section on the
  Main Page.\nTo prevent highly visible vandalism, each page in this queue is protected
  from editing while it appears on the Main Page. Otherwise, they are freely editable
  throughout most of the year.\n\nSelected anniversaries on this day\n\nDecember 14:
  Day of the Martyred Intellectuals in Bangladesh (1971); Monkey Day\n\n\nMax Planck\n\n\n835
  – In the Sweet Dew Incident, Emperor Wenzong of the Tang dynasty conspired to kill
  the powerful eunuchs of the Tang court, but the plot was foiled.\n1836 – The Toledo
  War, the mostly bloodless boundary dispute between Ohio and the adjoining Territory
  of Michigan, unofficially ended with a resolution passed by the controversial \"Frostbitten
  Convention\".\n1900 – German physicist Max Planck (pictured) presented a theoretical
  derivation of his black-body radiation law, suggesting that electromagnetic energy
  could only be emitted in quantized form.\n1962 – NASA's Mariner 2 became the world's
  first spacecraft to successfully conduct a planetary encounter when it flew by Venus.\n2012
  – A 20-year-old gunman shot twenty children and six adult staff members in a mass
  murder at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, US.\nMore anniversaries:\n\nDecember

  date: December 14, 2015 (UTC)\nReload this page\n\n\n\nview – talk – page history
  – related changes – edit (admins only)\n\nHow to make suggestions for listings[edit]\nBe
  bold while improving this queue but please make sure you follow the guidelines.
  Important: although anniversary listings on individual date articles are written
  in the present tense, \"selected anniversary listings\" should be in the past tense,
  to help distinguish them from current events when displayed on the Main Page.\nIf
  you want to add an item to yesterday's, today's, or tomorrow's listings, you need
  to be an administrator because those templates are protected. If you're not, add
  them to the talk page, such as Wikipedia talk:Selected anniversaries/December 14.\nFor
  unprotected days, go ahead and add them directly to the page, such as Wikipedia:Selected
  anniversaries/December 16. If you replace a visible one, be sure you return the
  one you removed to the staging area collapsible box.\nIf you're not sure what to
  do or how to best phrase the blurb, make your suggestion on the day's talk page.\nCriteria
  for listing items on this set of pages[edit]\n\nShortcut:\nWP:OTDRULES\n\nThe criteria
  for inclusion in the selected anniversaries queue are rather subjective due to the
  fact that any given day of the year can have a great many historical events worthy
  of listing. So relative article quality along with the mix of topics already listed
  are often deciding factors. Criteria for inclusion:\nGenerally 5 events can be displayed
  each day. This number may vary slightly depending on the length of the Wikipedia:Today's
  featured article and Wikipedia:Did you know sections so that the left and right
  columns appear balanced without too much empty space. Preference is given to anniversaries
  celebrating a significant anniversary. For events 100 years old and up, that means
  multiples of 25 (e.g., 200th, 325th, 550th, etc). If it's less than 100 years old,
  that means in multiples of 25 or 10 (e.g., 75th, 60th, 30th).\nHolidays/observances
  should be limited to a maximum of 3, but this may also increase to accommodate those
  that do not appear on the same date each year. Holidays should be listed in this
  order: international observances (secular followed by religious) first (except those
  that are not serious in nature, e.g., International Talk Like a Pirate Day—these
  should appear at the end of the list), then alphabetically by country where observed.
  When the same day is observed in multiple countries (but not worldwide), then the
  countries should be listed alphabetically, and the first country used for sorting.\nThe
  event needs to be of moderate to great historical significance (relative to the
  other historical events that occurred on the same day of the year). It should also
  be the most, or one of the most, important events associated with the selected article.
  Finally, the event should have occurred on the day in question (according to the
  Gregorian calendar) in local time, or UTC if local time is not applicable (e.g.,
  not on Earth).\nThe event and the selected article (bolded item) needs to be listed
  in the Events section of its corresponding day-of-the-year article, and therefore
  should also comply with the criteria for inclusion listed on Wikipedia:Days of the
  year.\nIf the holiday or observance occurs on the same day each Gregorian year,
  it needs to be in the Holidays/Observances section on the corresponding day-of-the-year
  article. Non Gregorian-based holidays, whose date of observance varies from year-to-year,
  do not have to be listed on the day-of-the-year articles, but should still comply
  with the rest of WP:DOY#Holidays and observances.\nThe historical event needs to
  be important enough to be included in the selected article (bolded item).\nThe selected
  article needs to be updated to clearly state the event or day of the celebration/observance,
  as well as the exact day it occurred/occurs. Non-Gregorian-based holidays and observances
  need not state the exact day since this will differ each year. The date must be
  a cited to a reliable source with an inline citation, since inline citations are
  used to support specific statements in an article.\nThe selected article (bolded
  item) must not be a stub and preferably it should be a relatively complete and well-formatted
  article, free from 'yellow'-level or more severe article issue tags. In other words,
  it should be a good example of Wikipedia content (see also Wikipedia:FAQ/Main Page#I
  think that the articles listed on the Main Page are awful. Isn't the Main Page biased
  towards certain topics? What can be done about it?). Conversely, preference is not
  given to featured articles or even good articles. All articles that meet the minimum
  standard should be given the same weight.\nAs much as possible, the array of topics
  should include a variety of years (e.g., not just limited to the 20th century),
  geographical areas (e.g., more than just the Anglosphere), and subjects (e.g., not
  too many articles on war or technology).\nBirths and natural deaths of notable people
  can be used only on centennials. Unnatural deaths (assassinations, accidents, etc)
  of notable figures may be used at any time.\nIdeally, any particular selected article
  should only be listed (be an emboldened entry) once in this queue. To help make
  sure articles are not selected (emboldened item) more than once, check the article's
  links and examine all the pages listed that begin with Wikipedia:Selected anniversaries/.
  There is no limit to the number of times an article can be incidentally linked in
  the queue (this includes all the non-bolded links). Exceptions are made for holidays/observances,
  as the same holiday may be celebrated on different dates in different countries,
  and country articles, as they may be the emboldened entry for holidays such as Independence
  Day if the nation's observance doesn't have its own article.\nSo, a combination
  of the \"majorness\" of the event, the mix of items already listed, and the relative
  completeness of the article, are the criteria used, along with the requirement for
  appropriate \"context\" and minimal compliance with Wikipedia:Days of the year.\nLastly,
  entries are written in the past tense, preferably in a single sentence.\nCriteria
  for listing images in day entries[edit]\nOnly one image should be displayed for
  any particular day entry at any one time. The image, however, can be switched throughout
  the day.\nThe image should be no more than 100px wide and 100px high. Because the
  image is so small, the subject should be easily distinguished at that size. Judicious
  cropping may also be employed to highlight a specific aspect of the image (see {{m-cropped}}).\nFor
  design purposes, if there is choice between an image of a person facing left and
  a person facing right, pick the face-left one–it draws the reader's attention toward
  the associated text, rather than away from it.\nOnly free images (PD, GFDL, CC etc.)
  can appear on the Main Page. Non-free images are not permitted.\nImage code: {{main
  page image|File:Example.svg|This is an example}} (see Template:Main page image for
  complete documentation).\nStaging area[edit]\nA list of other available events and
  images can be viewed at the specific subpage in the \"staging area\" (the staging
  area is not visible when transcluded onto another page thanks to <noinclude></noinclude>
  tags). Some of these items (the \"Eligible\" section) can be used as backups that
  can be rotated in and out from year to year. Other items are listed as \"Ineligible\"
  because they no longer pass the selected anniversaries criteria (see above), and
  thus need to be cleaned up.\nAdmins: When removing items from these pages while
  they are on the Main Page, please consider moving them into the \"staging area\"
  instead of outright deleting them so they can prospectively be used again in the
  future.\nAlso, to maintain some variety of topics on the Main Page as a whole, an
  event should be hidden if it is also the featured article or the featured picture
  for that particular day.\nMaintenance guidelines[edit]\nBecause each of the selected
  anniversaries pages rotate onto the Main Page every year, they will each need annual
  maintenance before they appear there:\nNon-Gregorian-based holidays and observances
  should be moved to the correct day for the current year. When moved, they should
  not count towards the maximum \"3 holidays/observances per day\" limit since a number
  of them might suddenly fall on the same day during a particular year.[1][2] These
  holidays and observances should also be marked with the current year in parentheses
  as a reminder to others that their dates do in fact vary from year to year.\nIn
  general, National Days, Independence Days, and other holidays celebrating the nationhood
  of a country should be marked by the year of the significant historic date being
  observed. An exception can be made when non-Gregorian-based holidays also fall within
  the same day, and the non-consistent use of dates might confuse new users.[1]\nEach
  emboldened article should be checked to make sure they still qualify under the selected
  anniversaries criteria. For those that do not, there are two options: An alternate
  emboldened article can be selected for the same event if one exists, especially
  if the original emboldened article was merged or split. Otherwise, it should be
  moved to the staging area, clearly marked that it needs cleanup.\nMake sure to double
  check, copyedit, and verify each event on the selected anniversaries page so it
  is consistent with the facts presented in the emboldened article, since they may
  have changed since the previous year.\nAfter your changes, please edit the talk
  page to indicate what changes were made, following the examples that are already
  there.\nResources for finding new suggestions[edit]\nList of historical anniversaries\nTemplate:Core

  /* @nomin */\n} );This set of pages serves as a queue of selected anniversaries
  in history taken from each day of the year's events and holidays/observances section
  and from current Jewish, Islamic, and other lunar-based calendars. The selected
  anniversaries queue is used to help facilitate and coordinate updates to the \"On
  this day\" section on the Main Page.To prevent highly visible vandalism, each page
  in this queue is protected from editing while it appears on the Main Page. Otherwise,
  they are freely editable throughout most of the year.December 14: Day of the Martyred
  Intellectuals in Bangladesh (1971); Monkey DayBe bold while improving this queue
  but please make sure you follow the guidelines. Important: although anniversary
  listings on individual date articles are written in the present tense, \"selected
  anniversary listings\" should be in the past tense, to help distinguish them from
  current events when displayed on the Main Page.The criteria for inclusion in the
  selected anniversaries queue are rather subjective due to the fact that any given
  day of the year can have a great many historical events worthy of listing. So relative
  article quality along with the mix of topics already listed are often deciding factors.
  Criteria for inclusion:Ideally, any particular selected article should only be listed
  (be an emboldened entry) once in this queue. To help make sure articles are not
  selected (emboldened item) more than once, check the article's links and examine
  all the pages listed that begin with Wikipedia:Selected anniversaries/. There is
  no limit to the number of times an article can be incidentally linked in the queue
  (this includes all the non-bolded links). Exceptions are made for holidays/observances,
  as the same holiday may be celebrated on different dates in different countries,
  and country articles, as they may be the emboldened entry for holidays such as Independence
  Day if the nation's observance doesn't have its own article.So, a combination of
  the \"majorness\" of the event, the mix of items already listed, and the relative
  completeness of the article, are the criteria used, along with the requirement for
  appropriate \"context\" and minimal compliance with Wikipedia:Days of the year.Lastly,
  entries are written in the past tense, preferably in a single sentence.Image code:
  {{main page image|File:Example.svg|This is an example}} (see Template:Main page
  image for complete documentation).A list of other available events and images can
  be viewed at the specific subpage in the \"staging area\" (the staging area is not
  visible when transcluded onto another page thanks to <noinclude></noinclude> tags).
  Some of these items (the \"Eligible\" section) can be used as backups that can be
  rotated in and out from year to year. Other items are listed as \"Ineligible\" because
  they no longer pass the selected anniversaries criteria (see above), and thus need
  to be cleaned up.Admins: When removing items from these pages while they are on
  the Main Page, please consider moving them into the \"staging area\" instead of
  outright deleting them so they can prospectively be used again in the future.Also,
  to maintain some variety of topics on the Main Page as a whole, an event should
  be hidden if it is also the featured article or the featured picture for that particular
  day.Because each of the selected anniversaries pages rotate onto the Main Page every
  year, they will each need annual maintenance before they appear there:Selected anniversaries/On
