  Hendrix in 1968
- |2+

- |
  American rock musician Jimi Hendrix was charged with drug possession in Canada in May 1969. Customs agents at Toronto International Airport detained Hendrix (pictured) after finding a small amount of heroin and hashish in his luggage. Released on $10,000 bail, he performed at Maple Leaf Gardens later that night, joking with the crowd. In December he stood trial for two counts of illegal possession of narcotics, carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Judge Joseph Kelly presided. Defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the narcotics belonged to Hendrix, who had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage or needle tracks on his arms, and whether he even knew they were in his luggage. He was acquitted after a three-day trial. Both of Hendrix's bandmates in the Jimi Hendrix Experience, Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding, later said that they had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto and that they believed the drugs had been planted in his bag. Hendrix was the world's highest-paid performer when he was arrested, but this was his last tour, and he died the following year. (Full article...)

  The Toledo War (1835–36) was a nearly bloodless sovereignty dispute between the US state of Ohio and the Michigan Territory over a small strip of land along their border, fueled by conflicting legislation, a desire to control the then-prosperous city of Toledo, and poor maps (example pictured). After Ohio politicians blocked Michigan's bid to become a state, both sides raised militias to enforce their claims.The only casualty was a wounded sheriff, stabbed with a penknife, and in the only clash, Michigan militiamen fired shots in the air and captured Ohioan surveyors. After President Andrew Jackson intervened to keep Ohio's support for his fledgling Democratic Party, Michigan agreed at what is now called the Frostbitten Convention to a compromise. The strip was sacrificed in exchange for statehood and the undeveloped Upper Peninsula, which would later produce an economic windfall in timber, iron, and copper. Vestiges of the dispute persisted for 137 years and were ended only with the help of the US Supreme Court in 1973. Memories of the Toledo War helped ignite the Michigan–Ohio State football rivalry.

  includes a section where an adapted lead section from one of Wikipedia's featured
  articles is displayed as \"Today's featured article\" (TFA). The current month's
  queue can be found here. TFAs are scheduled by the TFA coordinators, Brianboulton
  (Brian), Crisco 1492 (Chris) and Dank (Dan). Community discussion of suggestions
  takes place at the TFA requests page.\nIf you notice an error in a future TFA blurb,
  you can usually fix it yourself, but if the mistake is in today or tomorrow's blurb,
  you will need to leave a message at WP:ERRORS to ask an administrator to fix it.

  in 1968\n\n\nAmerican rock musician Jimi Hendrix was charged with drug possession
  in Canada in May 1969. Customs agents at Toronto International Airport detained
  Hendrix (pictured) after finding a small amount of heroin and hashish in his luggage.
  Released on $10,000 bail, he performed at Maple Leaf Gardens later that night, joking
  with the crowd. In December he stood trial for two counts of illegal possession
  of narcotics, carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Judge Joseph Kelly
  presided. Defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the narcotics
  belonged to Hendrix, who had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage or needle tracks
  on his arms, and whether he even knew they were in his luggage. He was acquitted
  after a three-day trial. Both of Hendrix's bandmates in the Jimi Hendrix Experience,
  Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding, later said that they had been warned about a planned
  drug bust the day before flying to Toronto and that they believed the drugs had
  been planted in his bag. Hendrix was the world's highest-paid performer when he
  was arrested, but this was his last tour, and he died the following year. (Full article...)\nRecently

  (1835–36) was a nearly bloodless sovereignty dispute between the US state of Ohio
  and the Michigan Territory over a small strip of land along their border, fueled
  by conflicting legislation, a desire to control the then-prosperous city of Toledo,
  and poor maps (example pictured). After Ohio politicians blocked Michigan's bid
  to become a state, both sides raised militias to enforce their claims.The only casualty
  was a wounded sheriff, stabbed with a penknife, and in the only clash, Michigan
  militiamen fired shots in the air and captured Ohioan surveyors. After President
  Andrew Jackson intervened to keep Ohio's support for his fledgling Democratic Party,
  Michigan agreed at what is now called the Frostbitten Convention to a compromise.
  The strip was sacrificed in exchange for statehood and the undeveloped Upper Peninsula,
  which would later produce an economic windfall in timber, iron, and copper. Vestiges
  of the dispute persisted for 137 years and were ended only with the help of the
  US Supreme Court in 1973. Memories of the Toledo War helped ignite the Michigan–Ohio
