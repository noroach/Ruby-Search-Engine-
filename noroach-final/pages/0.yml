  Site of a bloodless battle in 1835
- |2+

- |2+

- |
  The Toledo War (1835–36) was a nearly bloodless sovereignty dispute between the US state of Ohio and the Michigan Territory over a small strip of land along their border, fueled by conflicting legislation, a desire to control the then-prosperous city of Toledo, and poor maps. After Ohio politicians blocked Michigan's bid to become a state, both sides raised militias to enforce their claims.The only casualty was a wounded sheriff, stabbed with a penknife, and in the only clash, Michigan militiamen fired shots in the air and captured Ohioan surveyors. After President Andrew Jackson intervened to keep Ohio's support for his fledgling Democratic Party, Michigan agreed at what is now called the Frostbitten Convention to a compromise. The strip was sacrificed in exchange for statehood and the undeveloped Upper Peninsula, which would later produce an economic windfall in timber, iron, and copper. Vestiges of the dispute persisted for 137 years and were ended only with the help of the US Supreme Court in 1973. Memories of the Toledo War helped ignite the Michigan–Ohio State football rivalry.

  Neil Druckmann

  The relationship between the main characters in The Last of Us, an action-adventure survival horror video game developed by Naughty Dog, became the basis of the game's development. The two main characters in The Last of Us are an older man, Joel, and a teenaged girl, Ellie. Joel is tasked with escorting Ellie across a post-apocalyptic United States in an attempt to create a potential cure against an infection to which Ellie is immune. Joel is the primary playable character of the game, though players assume control of Ellie for a short portion. Throughout their journey, Joel and Ellie meet various characters. A team at Naughty Dog designed the character appearances, and creative director Neil Druckmann (pictured) was the main writer of their personalities and mannerisms. The actors were given considerable license to improvise the lines and influence character personality, simultaneously performing the motion capture work for their characters. Various characters were influenced by the story progression, ultimately becoming completely different from the initial vision. (Full list...)

  in 1835\n\n\nThe Toledo War (1835–36) was a nearly bloodless sovereignty dispute
  between the US state of Ohio and the Michigan Territory over a small strip of land
  along their border, fueled by conflicting legislation, a desire to control the then-prosperous
  city of Toledo, and poor maps. After Ohio politicians blocked Michigan's bid to
  become a state, both sides raised militias to enforce their claims.The only casualty
  was a wounded sheriff, stabbed with a penknife, and in the only clash, Michigan
  militiamen fired shots in the air and captured Ohioan surveyors. After President
  Andrew Jackson intervened to keep Ohio's support for his fledgling Democratic Party,
  Michigan agreed at what is now called the Frostbitten Convention to a compromise.
  The strip was sacrificed in exchange for statehood and the undeveloped Upper Peninsula,
  which would later produce an economic windfall in timber, iron, and copper. Vestiges
  of the dispute persisted for 137 years and were ended only with the help of the
  US Supreme Court in 1973. Memories of the Toledo War helped ignite the Michigan–Ohio
  State football rivalry. (Full article...)\nRecently featured:\n\nCanadian drug charges

  action-adventure survival horror video game developed by Naughty Dog, became the
  basis of the game's development. The two main characters in The Last of Us are an
  older man, Joel, and a teenaged girl, Ellie. Joel is tasked with escorting Ellie
  across a post-apocalyptic United States in an attempt to create a potential cure
  against an infection to which Ellie is immune. Joel is the primary playable character
  of the game, though players assume control of Ellie for a short portion. Throughout
  their journey, Joel and Ellie meet various characters. A team at Naughty Dog designed
  the character appearances, and creative director Neil Druckmann (pictured) was the
  main writer of their personalities and mannerisms. The actors were given considerable
  license to improvise the lines and influence character personality, simultaneously
  performing the motion capture work for their characters. Various characters were
  influenced by the story progression, ultimately becoming completely different from
  the initial vision. (Full list...)\nRecently featured:\n\nNature reserves in Barnet\nEurasian
