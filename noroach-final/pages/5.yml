  Coordinated Universal Time (French: temps universel coordonné), abbreviated as UTC, is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time. It is, within about 1 second, mean solar time at 0° longitude;[1] it does not observe daylight saving time. It is one of several closely related successors to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). For most purposes, UTC is considered interchangeable with GMT, but GMT is no longer precisely defined by the scientific community.
- |
  UTC was officially formalized in 1960 by the International Radio Consultative Committee in Recommendation 374,[2] having been initiated by several national time laboratories. The system was adjusted several times until leap seconds were adopted in 1972 to simplify future adjustments. A number of proposals have been made to replace UTC with a new system that would eliminate leap seconds but no consensus has yet been reached.
- |
  The current version of UTC is defined by International Telecommunications Union Recommendation (ITU-R TF.460-6), Standard-frequency and time-signal emissions[3] and is based on International Atomic Time (TAI) with leap seconds added at irregular intervals to compensate for the slowing of Earth's rotation.[4] Leap seconds are inserted as necessary to keep UTC within 0.9 second of universal time, UT1.[5] See the "Current number of leap seconds" section for the number of leap seconds inserted to date.

  The official abbreviation for Coordinated Universal Time is UTC. This abbreviation arose from a desire by the International Telecommunication Union and the International Astronomical Union to use the same abbreviation in all languages. English speakers originally proposed CUT (for "coordinated universal time"), while French speakers proposed TUC (for "temps universel coordonné"). The compromise that emerged was UTC,[8] which conforms to the pattern for the abbreviations of the variants of Universal Time (UT0, UT1, UT2, UT1R, etc.).[9]

  Uses
- |
  Time zones around the world are expressed using positive or negative offsets from UTC, as in the list of time zones by UTC offset.
- |
  The westernmost time zone uses UTC−12, being twelve hours behind UTC; the easternmost time zone, theoretically, uses UTC+12, being twelve hours ahead of UTC. In 1995, the island nation of Kiribati moved those of its atolls in the Line Islands from UTC-10 to UTC+14 so that the country would all be on the same day.
- |
  UTC is used in many Internet and World Wide Web standards. The Network Time Protocol, designed to synchronise the clocks of computers over the Internet, encodes times using the UTC system.[10] Computer servers, online services and other entities that rely on having a universally accepted time use UTC as it is more specific than GMT. If only limited precision is needed, clients can obtain the current UTC from a number of official Internet UTC servers. For sub-microsecond precision, clients can obtain the time from satellite signals.
- |
  UTC is also the time standard used in aviation,[11] e.g. for flight plans and air traffic control clearances. Weather forecasts and maps all use UTC to avoid confusion about time zones and daylight saving time. The International Space Station also uses UTC as a time standard.
- |
  Amateur radio operators often schedule their radio contacts in UTC, because transmissions on some frequencies can be picked up by many timezones.[12]
- |
  UTC is also used in digital tachographs used on large goods vehicles (LGV) under EU and AETR rules.
- |
  Mechanism
- |
  UTC divides time into days, hours, minutes and seconds. Days are conventionally identified using the Gregorian calendar, but Julian day numbers can also be used. Each day contains 24 hours and each hour contains 60 minutes. The number of seconds in a minute is usually 60, but with an occasional leap second, it may be 61 or 59 instead.[13] Thus, in the UTC time scale, the second and all smaller time units (millisecond, microsecond, etc.) are of constant duration, but the minute and all larger time units (hour, day, week, etc.) are of variable duration. Decisions to introduce a leap second are announced at least six months in advance in "Bulletin C" produced by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service.[14][15] The leap seconds cannot be predicted far in advance due to the unpredictable rate of rotation of the Earth.[16]
- |
  Nearly all UTC days contain exactly 86,400 SI seconds, with exactly 60 seconds in each minute. However, because the mean solar day is slightly longer than 86,400 SI seconds, occasionally the last minute of a UTC day is adjusted to have 61 seconds. The extra second is called a leap second. It accounts for the grand total of the extra length (about 2 milliseconds each) of all the mean solar days since the previous leap second. The last minute of a UTC day is permitted to contain 59 seconds to cover the remote possibility of the Earth rotating faster, but that has not yet been necessary. The irregular day lengths mean that fractional Julian days do not work properly with UTC.
- |
  Since 1972, UTC is calculated by subtracting the accumulated leap seconds from International Atomic Time (TAI), which is a coordinate time scale tracking notional proper time on the rotating surface of the Earth (the geoid). In order to maintain a close approximation to UT1 (equivalent to GMT), UTC occasionally has discontinuities where it changes from one linear function of TAI to another. These discontinuities take the form of leap seconds implemented by a UTC day of irregular length. Discontinuities in UTC have occurred only at the end of June or December, although there is provision for them to happen at the end of March and September as well as a second preference.[17][18] The International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) tracks and publishes the difference between UTC and Universal Time, DUT1 = UT1 – UTC, and introduces discontinuities into UTC to keep DUT1 in the interval (−0.9 s, +0.9 s).
- |
  As with TAI, UTC is only known with the highest precision in retrospect. Users who require an approximation in real time must obtain it from a time laboratory, which disseminates an approximation using techniques such as GPS or radio time signals. Such approximations are designated UTC(k), where k is an abbreviation for the time laboratory.[19] The time of events may be provisionally recorded against one of these approximations; later corrections may be applied using the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) monthly publication of tables of differences between canonical TAI/UTC and TAI(k)/UTC(k) as estimated in real time by participating laboratories.[20] (See the article on International Atomic Time for details.)
- |
  Because of time dilation, a standard clock not on the geoid, or in rapid motion, will not maintain synchronicity with UTC. Therefore, telemetry from clocks with a known relation to the geoid is used to provide UTC when required, on locations such as those of spacecraft.
- |
  It is not possible to compute the exact time interval elapsed between two UTC timestamps without consulting a table that describes how many leap seconds occurred during that interval. Therefore, many scientific applications that require precise measurement of long (multi-year) intervals use TAI instead. TAI is also commonly used by systems that cannot handle leap seconds. GPS time always remains exactly 19 seconds behind TAI (neither system is affected by the leap seconds introduced in UTC).
- |
  For most common and legal-trade purposes, the fractional second difference between UTC and UT (GMT) is inconsequentially small. Greenwich Mean Time is the legal standard in Britain during the winter, and this notation is familiar to and used by the population.[21]

  Time zones

  Main articles: Time zone and Lists of time zones

  See also: UTC offset and List of UTC time offsets
- |
  Time zones are usually defined as differing from UTC by an integer number of hours,[22] although the laws of each jurisdiction would have to be consulted if sub-second accuracy was required. Several jurisdictions have established time zones that differ by an integer number of half-hours or quarter-hours from UT1 or UTC.
- |
  Current civil time in a particular time zone can be determined by adding or subtracting the number of hours and minutes specified by the UTC offset, which ranges from UTC−12:00 in the west to UTC+14:00 in the east (see List of UTC time offsets).
- |
  The time zone using UTC is sometimes denoted UTC±00:00 or by the letter Z — a reference to the equivalent nautical time zone (GMT), which has been denoted by a Z since about 1950. Time zones were identified by successive letters of the alphabet and the Greenwich time zone was marked by a Z as it was the point of origin. The letter also refers to the "zone description" of zero hours, which has been used since 1920 (see time zone history). Since the NATO phonetic alphabet word for Z is "Zulu", UTC is sometimes known as "Zulu time". This is especially true in aviation, where "Zulu" is the universal standard.[23] This ensures all pilots regardless of location are using the same 24-hour clock, thus avoiding confusion when flying between time zones.[24] See the list of military time zones for letters used in addition to Z in qualifying time zones other than Greenwich.
- |
  On electronic devices that only allow the current time zone to be configured using maps or city names, UTC can be selected indirectly by selecting Reykjavík, Iceland, which is always on UTC and does not use daylight saving time.[25]

  Daylight saving time
- |
  Main article: Daylight saving time
- |
  UTC does not change with a change of seasons, but local time or civil time may change if a time zone jurisdiction observes daylight saving time (summer time). For example, local time on the east coast of the United States is five hours behind UTC during winter, but four hours behind while daylight saving is observed there.[26]

  History
- |
  At the 1884 International Meridian Conference held in Washington, D.C., the local mean solar time at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in England was chosen to define the Universal day, counted from 0 hours at mean midnight. This agreed with civil Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), used on the island of Great Britain since 1847. In contrast, astronomical GMT began at mean noon, 12 hours after mean midnight of the same date until 1 January 1925, whereas nautical GMT began at mean noon, 12 hours before mean midnight of the same date, at least until 1805 in the Royal Navy, but persisted much later elsewhere because it was mentioned at the 1884 conference. In 1884, the Greenwich Meridian was used for two-thirds of all charts and maps as their Prime Meridian.[27] In 1928, the term Universal Time (UT) was introduced by the International Astronomical Union to refer to GMT, with the day starting at midnight.[28] Until the 1950s, broadcast time signals were based on UT, and hence on the rotation of the Earth.
- |
  In 1955, the caesium atomic clock was invented. This provided a form of timekeeping that was both more stable and more convenient than astronomical observations. In 1956, the U.S. National Bureau of Standards and U.S. Naval Observatory started to develop atomic frequency time scales; by 1959, these time scales were used in generating the WWV time signals, named for the shortwave radio station that broadcasts them. In 1960, the U.S. Naval Observatory, the Royal Greenwich Observatory, and the UK National Physical Laboratory coordinated their radio broadcasts so time steps and frequency changes were coordinated, and the resulting time scale was informally referred to as "Coordinated Universal Time".[29]
- |
  In a controversial decision, the frequency of the signals was initially set to match the rate of UT, but then kept at the same frequency by the use of atomic clocks and deliberately allowed to drift away from UT. When the divergence grew significantly, the signal was phase shifted (stepped) by 20 ms to bring it back into agreement with UT. Twenty-nine such steps were used before 1960.[30]
- |
  In 1958, data was published linking the frequency for the caesium transition, newly established, with the ephemeris second.[31] The ephemeris second is the duration of time that, when used as the independent variable in the laws of motion that govern the movement of the planets and moons in the solar system, causes the laws of motion to accurately predict the observed positions of solar system bodies. Within the limits of observing accuracy, ephemeris seconds are of constant length, as are atomic seconds. This publication allowed a value to be chosen for the length of the atomic second that would work properly with the celestial laws of motion.[32]
- |
  In 1961 the Bureau International de l'Heure began coordinating the UTC process internationally (but the name Coordinated Universal Time was not adopted by the International Astronomical Union until 1967).[33][34] Time steps occurred every few months thereafter, and frequency changes at the end of each year. The jumps increased in size to 100 ms. This UTC was intended to permit a very close approximation to UT2.[29]
- |
  In 1967, the SI second was redefined in terms of the frequency supplied by a caesium atomic clock. The length of second so defined was practically equal to the second of ephemeris time.[35] This was the frequency that had been provisionally used in TAI since 1958. It was soon recognised that having two types of second with different lengths, namely the UTC second and the SI second used in TAI, was a bad idea. It was thought that it would be better for time signals to maintain a consistent frequency, and that that frequency should match the SI second. Thus it would be necessary to rely on time steps alone to maintain the approximation of UT. This was tried experimentally in a service known as "Stepped Atomic Time" (SAT), which ticked at the same rate as TAI and used jumps of 200 ms to stay synchronised with UT2.[2]
- |
  There was also dissatisfaction with the frequent jumps in UTC (and SAT). In 1968, Louis Essen, the inventor of the caesium atomic clock, and G. M. R. Winkler both independently proposed that steps should be of 1 s only.[36] This system was eventually approved, along with the idea of maintaining the UTC second equal to the TAI second. At the end of 1971, there was a final irregular jump of exactly 0.107758 TAI seconds, so that 1 January 1972 00:00:00 UTC was 1 January 1972 00:00:10 TAI exactly, making the difference between UTC and TAI an integer number of seconds. At the same time, the tick rate of UTC was changed to exactly match TAI. UTC also started to track UT1 rather than UT2. Some time signals started to broadcast the DUT1 correction (UT1 − UTC) for applications requiring a closer approximation of UT1 than UTC now provided.[37][38]

  Current number of leap seconds
- |
  The first leap second occurred on 30 June 1972. Since then, leap seconds have occurred on average about once every 19 months, always on 30 June or 31 December. As of July 2015, there have been 26 leap seconds in total, all positive, putting UTC 36 seconds behind TAI.[39]

  Earth's rotational speed is very slowly decreasing because of tidal deceleration; this increases the length of the mean solar day. The length of the SI second was calibrated on the basis of the second of ephemeris time[32][35] and can now be seen to have a relationship with the mean solar day observed between 1750 and 1892, analysed by Simon Newcomb. As a result, the SI second is close to 1/86400 of a mean solar day in the mid‑19th century.[40] In earlier centuries, the mean solar day was shorter than 86,400 SI seconds, and in more recent centuries it is longer than 86,400 seconds. Near the end of the 20th century, the length of the mean solar day (also known simply as "length of day" or "LOD") was approximately 86,400.0013 s.[41] For this reason, UT is now "slower" than TAI by the difference (or "excess" LOD) of 1.3 ms/day.
- |
  The excess of the LOD over the nominal 86,400 s accumulates over time, causing the UTC day, initially synchronised with the mean sun, to become desynchronised and run ahead of it. Near the end of the 20th century, with the LOD at 1.3 ms above the nominal value, UTC ran faster than UT by 1.3 ms per day, getting a second ahead roughly every 800 days. Thus, leap seconds were inserted at approximately this interval, retarding UTC to keep it synchronised in the long term.[42] The actual rotational period varies on unpredictable factors such as tectonic motion and has to be observed, rather than computed.
- |
  Just as adding a leap day every four years does not mean the year is getting longer by one day every four years, the insertion of a leap second every 800 days does not indicate that the mean solar day is getting longer by a second every 800 days. It will take approximately 50,000 years for a mean solar day to lengthen by one second (at a rate of 2 ms/cy, where cy means century). This rate fluctuates within the range of 1.7–2.3 ms/cy. While the rate due to tidal friction alone is about 2.3 ms/cy, the uplift of Canada and Scandinavia by several metres since the last Ice Age has temporarily reduced this to 1.7 ms/cy over the last 2,700 years.[43] The correct reason for leap seconds, then, is not the current difference between actual and nominal LOD, but rather the accumulation of this difference over a period of time: Near the end of the 20th century, this difference was about 1/800 of a second per day; therefore, after about 800 days, it accumulated to 1 second (and a leap second was then added).
- |
  In the graph of DUT1 above, the excess of LOD above the nominal 86,400 s corresponds to the downward slope of the graph between vertical segments. (The slope became shallower in the 2000s (decade), because of a slight acceleration of Earth's crust temporarily shortening the day.) Vertical position on the graph corresponds to the accumulation of this difference over time, and the vertical segments correspond to leap seconds introduced to match this accumulated difference. Leap seconds are timed to keep DUT1 within the vertical range depicted by this graph. The frequency of leap seconds therefore corresponds to the slope of the diagonal graph segments, and thus to the excess LOD.
- |
  Future
- |
  See also: Leap second
- |
  As the Earth's rotation continues to slow, positive leap seconds are required more frequently. The long-term rate of change of LOD is approximately +1.7 ms per century. At the end of the 21st century, LOD will be roughly 86,400.004 s, requiring leap seconds every 250 days. Over several centuries, the frequency of leap seconds will become problematic.
- |
  Some time in the 22nd century, two leap seconds will be required every year. The current use of only the leap second opportunities in June and December will be insufficient, and the March and September options will have to be used. In the 25th century, four leap seconds will be required every year, so the current quarterly options will be insufficient. Thereafter there will need to be the possibility of leap seconds at the end of any month. In about two thousand years, even that will be insufficient, and there will have to be leap seconds that are not at the end of a month.[44] In a few tens of thousands of years (the timing is uncertain), LOD will exceed 86,401 s, causing UTC to require more than one leap second per day.
- |
  In April 2001, Rob Seaman of the National Optical Astronomy Observatory proposed that leap seconds be allowed to be added monthly rather than twice yearly.[45]
- |
  There is a proposal to redefine UTC and abolish leap seconds, such that sundials would slowly get further out of sync with civil time.[46] The resulting gradual shift of the sun's movements relative to civil time is analogous to the shift of seasons relative to the yearly calendar that results from the calendar year not precisely matching the tropical year length. This would be a major practical change in civil timekeeping, but would take effect slowly over several centuries. UTC (and TAI) would be more and more ahead of UT; it would coincide with local mean time along a meridian drifting slowly eastward (reaching Paris and beyond).[47] Thus, the time system would lose its fixed connection to the geographic coordinates based on the IERS meridian. The difference between UTC and UT could reach 0.5 hour after the year 2600 and 6.5 hours around 4600.[44]
- |
  ITU‑R Study Group 7 and Working Party 7A were unable to reach consensus on whether to advance the proposal to the 2012 Radiocommunications Assembly; the chairman of Study Group 7 elected to advance the question to the 2012 Radiocommunications Assembly (20 January 2012),[48] but consideration of the proposal was postponed by the ITU until the World Radio Conference in 2015, convening on 2 November.[49]
- |
  The possibility of suppressing the leap second was considered in November 2015 at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-15), which is the international regulatory body which defines Coordinated Universal Time.[50] No decision to suppress leap seconds was reached; the issue will be studied further and reconsidered in 2023.[51]

- '} );Coordinated Universal Time (French: temps universel coordonné), abbreviated
  as UTC, is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time.
  It is, within about 1 second, mean solar time at 0° longitude;[1] it does not observe
  daylight saving time. It is one of several closely related successors to Greenwich
  Mean Time (GMT). For most purposes, UTC is considered interchangeable with GMT,
  but GMT is no longer precisely defined by the scientific community.UTC was officially
  formalized in 1960 by the International Radio Consultative Committee in Recommendation
  374,[2] having been initiated by several national time laboratories. The system
  was adjusted several times until leap seconds were adopted in 1972 to simplify future
  adjustments. A number of proposals have been made to replace UTC with a new system
  that would eliminate leap seconds but no consensus has yet been reached.The current
  version of UTC is defined by International Telecommunications Union Recommendation
  (ITU-R TF.460-6), Standard-frequency and time-signal emissions[3] and is based on
  International Atomic Time (TAI) with leap seconds added at irregular intervals to
  compensate for the slowing of Earth''s rotation.[4] Leap seconds are inserted as
  necessary to keep UTC within 0.9 second of universal time, UT1.[5] See the "Current
  number of leap seconds" section for the number of leap seconds inserted to date.The
  official abbreviation for Coordinated Universal Time is UTC. This abbreviation arose
  from a desire by the International Telecommunication Union and the International
  Astronomical Union to use the same abbreviation in all languages. English speakers
  originally proposed CUT (for "coordinated universal time"), while French speakers
  proposed TUC (for "temps universel coordonné"). The compromise that emerged was
  UTC,[8] which conforms to the pattern for the abbreviations of the variants of Universal
  Time (UT0, UT1, UT2, UT1R, etc.).[9]Time zones around the world are expressed using
  positive or negative offsets from UTC, as in the list of time zones by UTC offset.The
  westernmost time zone uses UTC−12, being twelve hours behind UTC; the easternmost
  time zone, theoretically, uses UTC+12, being twelve hours ahead of UTC. In 1995,
  the island nation of Kiribati moved those of its atolls in the Line Islands from
  UTC-10 to UTC+14 so that the country would all be on the same day.UTC is used in
  many Internet and World Wide Web standards. The Network Time Protocol, designed
  to synchronise the clocks of computers over the Internet, encodes times using the
  UTC system.[10] Computer servers, online services and other entities that rely on
  having a universally accepted time use UTC as it is more specific than GMT. If only
  limited precision is needed, clients can obtain the current UTC from a number of
  official Internet UTC servers. For sub-microsecond precision, clients can obtain
  the time from satellite signals.UTC is also the time standard used in aviation,[11]
  e.g. for flight plans and air traffic control clearances. Weather forecasts and
  maps all use UTC to avoid confusion about time zones and daylight saving time. The
  International Space Station also uses UTC as a time standard.Amateur radio operators
  often schedule their radio contacts in UTC, because transmissions on some frequencies
  can be picked up by many timezones.[12]UTC is also used in digital tachographs used
  on large goods vehicles (LGV) under EU and AETR rules.UTC divides time into days,
  hours, minutes and seconds. Days are conventionally identified using the Gregorian
  calendar, but Julian day numbers can also be used. Each day contains 24 hours and
  each hour contains 60 minutes. The number of seconds in a minute is usually 60,
  but with an occasional leap second, it may be 61 or 59 instead.[13] Thus, in the
  UTC time scale, the second and all smaller time units (millisecond, microsecond,
  etc.) are of constant duration, but the minute and all larger time units (hour,
  day, week, etc.) are of variable duration. Decisions to introduce a leap second
  are announced at least six months in advance in "Bulletin C" produced by the International
  Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service.[14][15] The leap seconds cannot be
  predicted far in advance due to the unpredictable rate of rotation of the Earth.[16]Nearly
  all UTC days contain exactly 86,400 SI seconds, with exactly 60 seconds in each
  minute. However, because the mean solar day is slightly longer than 86,400 SI seconds,
  occasionally the last minute of a UTC day is adjusted to have 61 seconds. The extra
  second is called a leap second. It accounts for the grand total of the extra length
  (about 2 milliseconds each) of all the mean solar days since the previous leap second.
  The last minute of a UTC day is permitted to contain 59 seconds to cover the remote
  possibility of the Earth rotating faster, but that has not yet been necessary. The
  irregular day lengths mean that fractional Julian days do not work properly with
  UTC.Since 1972, UTC is calculated by subtracting the accumulated leap seconds from
  International Atomic Time (TAI), which is a coordinate time scale tracking notional
  proper time on the rotating surface of the Earth (the geoid). In order to maintain
  a close approximation to UT1 (equivalent to GMT), UTC occasionally has discontinuities
  where it changes from one linear function of TAI to another. These discontinuities
  take the form of leap seconds implemented by a UTC day of irregular length. Discontinuities
  in UTC have occurred only at the end of June or December, although there is provision
  for them to happen at the end of March and September as well as a second preference.[17][18]
  The International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) tracks and
  publishes the difference between UTC and Universal Time, DUT1 = UT1 – UTC, and introduces
  discontinuities into UTC to keep DUT1 in the interval (−0.9 s, +0.9 s).As with TAI,
  UTC is only known with the highest precision in retrospect. Users who require an
  approximation in real time must obtain it from a time laboratory, which disseminates
  an approximation using techniques such as GPS or radio time signals. Such approximations
  are designated UTC(k), where k is an abbreviation for the time laboratory.[19] The
  time of events may be provisionally recorded against one of these approximations;
  later corrections may be applied using the International Bureau of Weights and Measures
  (BIPM) monthly publication of tables of differences between canonical TAI/UTC and
  TAI(k)/UTC(k) as estimated in real time by participating laboratories.[20] (See
  the article on International Atomic Time for details.)Because of time dilation,
  a standard clock not on the geoid, or in rapid motion, will not maintain synchronicity
  with UTC. Therefore, telemetry from clocks with a known relation to the geoid is
  used to provide UTC when required, on locations such as those of spacecraft.It is
  not possible to compute the exact time interval elapsed between two UTC timestamps
  without consulting a table that describes how many leap seconds occurred during
  that interval. Therefore, many scientific applications that require precise measurement
  of long (multi-year) intervals use TAI instead. TAI is also commonly used by systems
  that cannot handle leap seconds. GPS time always remains exactly 19 seconds behind
  TAI (neither system is affected by the leap seconds introduced in UTC).For most
  common and legal-trade purposes, the fractional second difference between UTC and
  UT (GMT) is inconsequentially small. Greenwich Mean Time is the legal standard in
  Britain during the winter, and this notation is familiar to and used by the population.[21]Time
  zones are usually defined as differing from UTC by an integer number of hours,[22]
  although the laws of each jurisdiction would have to be consulted if sub-second
  accuracy was required. Several jurisdictions have established time zones that differ
  by an integer number of half-hours or quarter-hours from UT1 or UTC.Current civil
  time in a particular time zone can be determined by adding or subtracting the number
  of hours and minutes specified by the UTC offset, which ranges from UTC−12:00 in
  the west to UTC+14:00 in the east (see List of UTC time offsets).The time zone using
  UTC is sometimes denoted UTC±00:00 or by the letter Z — a reference to the equivalent
  nautical time zone (GMT), which has been denoted by a Z since about 1950. Time zones
  were identified by successive letters of the alphabet and the Greenwich time zone
  was marked by a Z as it was the point of origin. The letter also refers to the "zone
  description" of zero hours, which has been used since 1920 (see time zone history).
  Since the NATO phonetic alphabet word for Z is "Zulu", UTC is sometimes known as
  "Zulu time". This is especially true in aviation, where "Zulu" is the universal
  standard.[23] This ensures all pilots regardless of location are using the same
  24-hour clock, thus avoiding confusion when flying between time zones.[24] See the
  list of military time zones for letters used in addition to Z in qualifying time
  zones other than Greenwich.On electronic devices that only allow the current time
  zone to be configured using maps or city names, UTC can be selected indirectly by
  selecting Reykjavík, Iceland, which is always on UTC and does not use daylight saving
  time.[25]UTC does not change with a change of seasons, but local time or civil time
  may change if a time zone jurisdiction observes daylight saving time (summer time).
  For example, local time on the east coast of the United States is five hours behind
  UTC during winter, but four hours behind while daylight saving is observed there.[26]At
  the 1884 International Meridian Conference held in Washington, D.C., the local mean
  solar time at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in England was chosen to define the
  Universal day, counted from 0 hours at mean midnight. This agreed with civil Greenwich
  Mean Time (GMT), used on the island of Great Britain since 1847. In contrast, astronomical
  GMT began at mean noon, 12 hours after mean midnight of the same date until 1 January
  1925, whereas nautical GMT began at mean noon, 12 hours before mean midnight of
  the same date, at least until 1805 in the Royal Navy, but persisted much later elsewhere
  because it was mentioned at the 1884 conference. In 1884, the Greenwich Meridian
  was used for two-thirds of all charts and maps as their Prime Meridian.[27] In 1928,
  the term Universal Time (UT) was introduced by the International Astronomical Union
  to refer to GMT, with the day starting at midnight.[28] Until the 1950s, broadcast
  time signals were based on UT, and hence on the rotation of the Earth.In 1955, the
  caesium atomic clock was invented. This provided a form of timekeeping that was
  both more stable and more convenient than astronomical observations. In 1956, the
  U.S. National Bureau of Standards and U.S. Naval Observatory started to develop
  atomic frequency time scales; by 1959, these time scales were used in generating
  the WWV time signals, named for the shortwave radio station that broadcasts them.
  In 1960, the U.S. Naval Observatory, the Royal Greenwich Observatory, and the UK
  National Physical Laboratory coordinated their radio broadcasts so time steps and
  frequency changes were coordinated, and the resulting time scale was informally
  referred to as "Coordinated Universal Time".[29]In a controversial decision, the
  frequency of the signals was initially set to match the rate of UT, but then kept
  at the same frequency by the use of atomic clocks and deliberately allowed to drift
  away from UT. When the divergence grew significantly, the signal was phase shifted
  (stepped) by 20 ms to bring it back into agreement with UT. Twenty-nine such steps
  were used before 1960.[30]In 1958, data was published linking the frequency for
  the caesium transition, newly established, with the ephemeris second.[31] The ephemeris
  second is the duration of time that, when used as the independent variable in the
  laws of motion that govern the movement of the planets and moons in the solar system,
  causes the laws of motion to accurately predict the observed positions of solar
  system bodies. Within the limits of observing accuracy, ephemeris seconds are of
  constant length, as are atomic seconds. This publication allowed a value to be chosen
  for the length of the atomic second that would work properly with the celestial
  laws of motion.[32]In 1961 the Bureau International de l''Heure began coordinating
  the UTC process internationally (but the name Coordinated Universal Time was not
  adopted by the International Astronomical Union until 1967).[33][34] Time steps
  occurred every few months thereafter, and frequency changes at the end of each year.
  The jumps increased in size to 100 ms. This UTC was intended to permit a very close
  approximation to UT2.[29]In 1967, the SI second was redefined in terms of the frequency
  supplied by a caesium atomic clock. The length of second so defined was practically
  equal to the second of ephemeris time.[35] This was the frequency that had been
  provisionally used in TAI since 1958. It was soon recognised that having two types
  of second with different lengths, namely the UTC second and the SI second used in
  TAI, was a bad idea. It was thought that it would be better for time signals to
  maintain a consistent frequency, and that that frequency should match the SI second.
  Thus it would be necessary to rely on time steps alone to maintain the approximation
  of UT. This was tried experimentally in a service known as "Stepped Atomic Time"
  (SAT), which ticked at the same rate as TAI and used jumps of 200 ms to stay synchronised
  with UT2.[2]There was also dissatisfaction with the frequent jumps in UTC (and SAT).
  In 1968, Louis Essen, the inventor of the caesium atomic clock, and G. M. R. Winkler
  both independently proposed that steps should be of 1 s only.[36] This system was
  eventually approved, along with the idea of maintaining the UTC second equal to
  the TAI second. At the end of 1971, there was a final irregular jump of exactly
  0.107758 TAI seconds, so that 1 January 1972 00:00:00 UTC was 1 January 1972 00:00:10
  TAI exactly, making the difference between UTC and TAI an integer number of seconds.
  At the same time, the tick rate of UTC was changed to exactly match TAI. UTC also
  started to track UT1 rather than UT2. Some time signals started to broadcast the
  DUT1 correction (UT1 − UTC) for applications requiring a closer approximation of
  UT1 than UTC now provided.[37][38]The first leap second occurred on 30 June 1972.
  Since then, leap seconds have occurred on average about once every 19 months, always
  on 30 June or 31 December. As of July 2015, there have been 26 leap seconds in total,
  all positive, putting UTC 36 seconds behind TAI.[39]Earth''s rotational speed is
  very slowly decreasing because of tidal deceleration; this increases the length
  of the mean solar day. The length of the SI second was calibrated on the basis of
  the second of ephemeris time[32][35] and can now be seen to have a relationship
  with the mean solar day observed between 1750 and 1892, analysed by Simon Newcomb.
  As a result, the SI second is close to 1/86400 of a mean solar day in the mid‑19th
  century.[40] In earlier centuries, the mean solar day was shorter than 86,400 SI
  seconds, and in more recent centuries it is longer than 86,400 seconds. Near the
  end of the 20th century, the length of the mean solar day (also known simply as
  "length of day" or "LOD") was approximately 86,400.0013 s.[41] For this reason,
  UT is now "slower" than TAI by the difference (or "excess" LOD) of 1.3 ms/day.The
  excess of the LOD over the nominal 86,400 s accumulates over time, causing the UTC
  day, initially synchronised with the mean sun, to become desynchronised and run
  ahead of it. Near the end of the 20th century, with the LOD at 1.3 ms above the
  nominal value, UTC ran faster than UT by 1.3 ms per day, getting a second ahead
  roughly every 800 days. Thus, leap seconds were inserted at approximately this interval,
  retarding UTC to keep it synchronised in the long term.[42] The actual rotational
  period varies on unpredictable factors such as tectonic motion and has to be observed,
  rather than computed.Just as adding a leap day every four years does not mean the
  year is getting longer by one day every four years, the insertion of a leap second
  every 800 days does not indicate that the mean solar day is getting longer by a
  second every 800 days. It will take approximately 50,000 years for a mean solar
  day to lengthen by one second (at a rate of 2 ms/cy, where cy means century). This
  rate fluctuates within the range of 1.7–2.3 ms/cy. While the rate due to tidal friction
  alone is about 2.3 ms/cy, the uplift of Canada and Scandinavia by several metres
  since the last Ice Age has temporarily reduced this to 1.7 ms/cy over the last 2,700 years.[43]
  The correct reason for leap seconds, then, is not the current difference between
  actual and nominal LOD, but rather the accumulation of this difference over a period
  of time: Near the end of the 20th century, this difference was about 1/800 of a
  second per day; therefore, after about 800 days, it accumulated to 1 second (and
  a leap second was then added).In the graph of DUT1 above, the excess of LOD above
  the nominal 86,400 s corresponds to the downward slope of the graph between vertical
  segments. (The slope became shallower in the 2000s (decade), because of a slight
  acceleration of Earth''s crust temporarily shortening the day.) Vertical position
  on the graph corresponds to the accumulation of this difference over time, and the
  vertical segments correspond to leap seconds introduced to match this accumulated
  difference. Leap seconds are timed to keep DUT1 within the vertical range depicted
  by this graph. The frequency of leap seconds therefore corresponds to the slope
  of the diagonal graph segments, and thus to the excess LOD.As the Earth''s rotation
  continues to slow, positive leap seconds are required more frequently. The long-term
  rate of change of LOD is approximately +1.7 ms per century. At the end of the 21st
  century, LOD will be roughly 86,400.004 s, requiring leap seconds every 250 days.
  Over several centuries, the frequency of leap seconds will become problematic.Some
  time in the 22nd century, two leap seconds will be required every year. The current
  use of only the leap second opportunities in June and December will be insufficient,
  and the March and September options will have to be used. In the 25th century, four
  leap seconds will be required every year, so the current quarterly options will
  be insufficient. Thereafter there will need to be the possibility of leap seconds
  at the end of any month. In about two thousand years, even that will be insufficient,
  and there will have to be leap seconds that are not at the end of a month.[44] In
  a few tens of thousands of years (the timing is uncertain), LOD will exceed 86,401 s,
  causing UTC to require more than one leap second per day.In April 2001, Rob Seaman
  of the National Optical Astronomy Observatory proposed that leap seconds be allowed
  to be added monthly rather than twice yearly.[45]There is a proposal to redefine
  UTC and abolish leap seconds, such that sundials would slowly get further out of
  sync with civil time.[46] The resulting gradual shift of the sun''s movements relative
  to civil time is analogous to the shift of seasons relative to the yearly calendar
  that results from the calendar year not precisely matching the tropical year length.
  This would be a major practical change in civil timekeeping, but would take effect
  slowly over several centuries. UTC (and TAI) would be more and more ahead of UT;
  it would coincide with local mean time along a meridian drifting slowly eastward
  (reaching Paris and beyond).[47] Thus, the time system would lose its fixed connection
  to the geographic coordinates based on the IERS meridian. The difference between
  UTC and UT could reach 0.5 hour after the year 2600 and 6.5 hours around 4600.[44]ITU‑R
  Study Group 7 and Working Party 7A were unable to reach consensus on whether to
  advance the proposal to the 2012 Radiocommunications Assembly; the chairman of Study
  Group 7 elected to advance the question to the 2012 Radiocommunications Assembly
  (20 January 2012),[48] but consideration of the proposal was postponed by the ITU
  until the World Radio Conference in 2015, convening on 2 November.[49]The possibility
  of suppressing the leap second was considered in November 2015 at the World Radiocommunication
  Conference (WRC-15), which is the international regulatory body which defines Coordinated
  Universal Time.[50] No decision to suppress leap seconds was reached; the issue
  will be studied further and reconsidered in 2023.[51]'

  For other uses, see UTC (disambiguation).\nThis article is about the time standard
  abbreviated as \"UTC\".  For the time offset between UTC−1 and UTC+1, see UTC±0.\n\n\n\n\nWorld
  map of current time zones\n\n\nCoordinated Universal Time (French: temps universel
  coordonné), abbreviated as UTC, is the primary time standard by which the world
  regulates clocks and time. It is, within about 1 second, mean solar time at 0° longitude;[1]
  it does not observe daylight saving time. It is one of several closely related successors
  to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). For most purposes, UTC is considered interchangeable
  with GMT, but GMT is no longer precisely defined by the scientific community.\nUTC
  was officially formalized in 1960 by the International Radio Consultative Committee
  in Recommendation 374,[2] having been initiated by several national time laboratories.
  The system was adjusted several times until leap seconds were adopted in 1972 to
  simplify future adjustments. A number of proposals have been made to replace UTC
  with a new system that would eliminate leap seconds but no consensus has yet been
  reached.\nThe current version of UTC is defined by International Telecommunications
  Union Recommendation (ITU-R TF.460-6), Standard-frequency and time-signal emissions[3]
  and is based on International Atomic Time (TAI) with leap seconds added at irregular
  intervals to compensate for the slowing of Earth's rotation.[4] Leap seconds are
  inserted as necessary to keep UTC within 0.9 second of universal time, UT1.[5] See
  the \"Current number of leap seconds\" section for the number of leap seconds inserted
  to date.\n\n\n\nContents\n\n1 Etymology\n2 Uses\n3 Mechanism\n3.1 Time zones\n3.2

  French: \"Universel Temps Coordonné\"[7]\n\nThe official abbreviation for Coordinated
  Universal Time is UTC. This abbreviation arose from a desire by the International
  Telecommunication Union and the International Astronomical Union to use the same
  abbreviation in all languages. English speakers originally proposed CUT (for \"coordinated
  universal time\"), while French speakers proposed TUC (for \"temps universel coordonné\").
  The compromise that emerged was UTC,[8] which conforms to the pattern for the abbreviations
  of the variants of Universal Time (UT0, UT1, UT2, UT1R, etc.).[9]\n\nUses\nTime
  zones around the world are expressed using positive or negative offsets from UTC,
  as in the list of time zones by UTC offset.\nThe westernmost time zone uses UTC−12,
  being twelve hours behind UTC; the easternmost time zone, theoretically, uses UTC+12,
  being twelve hours ahead of UTC. In 1995, the island nation of Kiribati moved those
  of its atolls in the Line Islands from UTC-10 to UTC+14 so that the country would
  all be on the same day.\nUTC is used in many Internet and World Wide Web standards.
  The Network Time Protocol, designed to synchronise the clocks of computers over
  the Internet, encodes times using the UTC system.[10] Computer servers, online services
  and other entities that rely on having a universally accepted time use UTC as it
  is more specific than GMT. If only limited precision is needed, clients can obtain
  the current UTC from a number of official Internet UTC servers. For sub-microsecond
  precision, clients can obtain the time from satellite signals.\nUTC is also the
  time standard used in aviation,[11] e.g. for flight plans and air traffic control
  clearances. Weather forecasts and maps all use UTC to avoid confusion about time
  zones and daylight saving time. The International Space Station also uses UTC as
  a time standard.\nAmateur radio operators often schedule their radio contacts in
  UTC, because transmissions on some frequencies can be picked up by many timezones.[12]\nUTC
  is also used in digital tachographs used on large goods vehicles (LGV) under EU
  and AETR rules.\nMechanism\nUTC divides time into days, hours, minutes and seconds.
  Days are conventionally identified using the Gregorian calendar, but Julian day
  numbers can also be used. Each day contains 24 hours and each hour contains 60 minutes.
  The number of seconds in a minute is usually 60, but with an occasional leap second,
  it may be 61 or 59 instead.[13] Thus, in the UTC time scale, the second and all
  smaller time units (millisecond, microsecond, etc.) are of constant duration, but
  the minute and all larger time units (hour, day, week, etc.) are of variable duration.
  Decisions to introduce a leap second are announced at least six months in advance
  in \"Bulletin C\" produced by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems
  Service.[14][15] The leap seconds cannot be predicted far in advance due to the
  unpredictable rate of rotation of the Earth.[16]\nNearly all UTC days contain exactly
  86,400 SI seconds, with exactly 60 seconds in each minute. However, because the
  mean solar day is slightly longer than 86,400 SI seconds, occasionally the last
  minute of a UTC day is adjusted to have 61 seconds. The extra second is called a
  leap second. It accounts for the grand total of the extra length (about 2 milliseconds
  each) of all the mean solar days since the previous leap second. The last minute
  of a UTC day is permitted to contain 59 seconds to cover the remote possibility
  of the Earth rotating faster, but that has not yet been necessary. The irregular
  day lengths mean that fractional Julian days do not work properly with UTC.\nSince
  1972, UTC is calculated by subtracting the accumulated leap seconds from International
  Atomic Time (TAI), which is a coordinate time scale tracking notional proper time
  on the rotating surface of the Earth (the geoid). In order to maintain a close approximation
  to UT1 (equivalent to GMT), UTC occasionally has discontinuities where it changes
  from one linear function of TAI to another. These discontinuities take the form
  of leap seconds implemented by a UTC day of irregular length. Discontinuities in
  UTC have occurred only at the end of June or December, although there is provision
  for them to happen at the end of March and September as well as a second preference.[17][18]
  The International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) tracks and
  publishes the difference between UTC and Universal Time, DUT1 = UT1 – UTC, and introduces
  discontinuities into UTC to keep DUT1 in the interval (−0.9 s, +0.9 s).\nAs with
  TAI, UTC is only known with the highest precision in retrospect. Users who require
  an approximation in real time must obtain it from a time laboratory, which disseminates
  an approximation using techniques such as GPS or radio time signals. Such approximations
  are designated UTC(k), where k is an abbreviation for the time laboratory.[19] The
  time of events may be provisionally recorded against one of these approximations;
  later corrections may be applied using the International Bureau of Weights and Measures
  (BIPM) monthly publication of tables of differences between canonical TAI/UTC and
  TAI(k)/UTC(k) as estimated in real time by participating laboratories.[20] (See
  the article on International Atomic Time for details.)\nBecause of time dilation,
  a standard clock not on the geoid, or in rapid motion, will not maintain synchronicity
  with UTC. Therefore, telemetry from clocks with a known relation to the geoid is
  used to provide UTC when required, on locations such as those of spacecraft.\nIt
  is not possible to compute the exact time interval elapsed between two UTC timestamps
  without consulting a table that describes how many leap seconds occurred during
  that interval. Therefore, many scientific applications that require precise measurement
  of long (multi-year) intervals use TAI instead. TAI is also commonly used by systems
  that cannot handle leap seconds. GPS time always remains exactly 19 seconds behind
  TAI (neither system is affected by the leap seconds introduced in UTC).\nFor most
  common and legal-trade purposes, the fractional second difference between UTC and
  UT (GMT) is inconsequentially small. Greenwich Mean Time is the legal standard in
  Britain during the winter, and this notation is familiar to and used by the population.[21]\nTime
  zones\nMain articles: Time zone and Lists of time zones\nSee also: UTC offset and
  List of UTC time offsets\nTime zones are usually defined as differing from UTC by
  an integer number of hours,[22] although the laws of each jurisdiction would have
  to be consulted if sub-second accuracy was required. Several jurisdictions have
  established time zones that differ by an integer number of half-hours or quarter-hours
  from UT1 or UTC.\nCurrent civil time in a particular time zone can be determined
  by adding or subtracting the number of hours and minutes specified by the UTC offset,
  which ranges from UTC−12:00 in the west to UTC+14:00 in the east (see List of UTC
  time offsets).\nThe time zone using UTC is sometimes denoted UTC±00:00 or by the
  letter Z — a reference to the equivalent nautical time zone (GMT), which has been
  denoted by a Z since about 1950. Time zones were identified by successive letters
  of the alphabet and the Greenwich time zone was marked by a Z as it was the point
  of origin. The letter also refers to the \"zone description\" of zero hours, which
  has been used since 1920 (see time zone history). Since the NATO phonetic alphabet
  word for Z is \"Zulu\", UTC is sometimes known as \"Zulu time\". This is especially
  true in aviation, where \"Zulu\" is the universal standard.[23] This ensures all
  pilots regardless of location are using the same 24-hour clock, thus avoiding confusion
  when flying between time zones.[24] See the list of military time zones for letters
  used in addition to Z in qualifying time zones other than Greenwich.\nOn electronic
  devices that only allow the current time zone to be configured using maps or city
  names, UTC can be selected indirectly by selecting Reykjavík, Iceland, which is
  always on UTC and does not use daylight saving time.[25]\nDaylight saving time\nMain
  article: Daylight saving time\nUTC does not change with a change of seasons, but
  local time or civil time may change if a time zone jurisdiction observes daylight
  saving time (summer time). For example, local time on the east coast of the United
  States is five hours behind UTC during winter, but four hours behind while daylight
  saving is observed there.[26]\nHistory\nAt the 1884 International Meridian Conference
  held in Washington, D.C., the local mean solar time at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich
  in England was chosen to define the Universal day, counted from 0 hours at mean
  midnight. This agreed with civil Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), used on the island of
  Great Britain since 1847. In contrast, astronomical GMT began at mean noon, 12 hours
  after mean midnight of the same date until 1 January 1925, whereas nautical GMT
  began at mean noon, 12 hours before mean midnight of the same date, at least until
  1805 in the Royal Navy, but persisted much later elsewhere because it was mentioned
  at the 1884 conference. In 1884, the Greenwich Meridian was used for two-thirds
  of all charts and maps as their Prime Meridian.[27] In 1928, the term Universal
  Time (UT) was introduced by the International Astronomical Union to refer to GMT,
  with the day starting at midnight.[28] Until the 1950s, broadcast time signals were
  based on UT, and hence on the rotation of the Earth.\nIn 1955, the caesium atomic
  clock was invented. This provided a form of timekeeping that was both more stable
  and more convenient than astronomical observations. In 1956, the U.S. National Bureau
  of Standards and U.S. Naval Observatory started to develop atomic frequency time
  scales; by 1959, these time scales were used in generating the WWV time signals,
  named for the shortwave radio station that broadcasts them. In 1960, the U.S. Naval
  Observatory, the Royal Greenwich Observatory, and the UK National Physical Laboratory
  coordinated their radio broadcasts so time steps and frequency changes were coordinated,
  and the resulting time scale was informally referred to as \"Coordinated Universal
  Time\".[29]\nIn a controversial decision, the frequency of the signals was initially
  set to match the rate of UT, but then kept at the same frequency by the use of atomic
  clocks and deliberately allowed to drift away from UT. When the divergence grew
  significantly, the signal was phase shifted (stepped) by 20 ms to bring it back
  into agreement with UT. Twenty-nine such steps were used before 1960.[30]\nIn 1958,
  data was published linking the frequency for the caesium transition, newly established,
  with the ephemeris second.[31] The ephemeris second is the duration of time that,
  when used as the independent variable in the laws of motion that govern the movement
  of the planets and moons in the solar system, causes the laws of motion to accurately
  predict the observed positions of solar system bodies. Within the limits of observing
  accuracy, ephemeris seconds are of constant length, as are atomic seconds. This
  publication allowed a value to be chosen for the length of the atomic second that
  would work properly with the celestial laws of motion.[32]\nIn 1961 the Bureau International
  de l'Heure began coordinating the UTC process internationally (but the name Coordinated
  Universal Time was not adopted by the International Astronomical Union until 1967).[33][34]
  Time steps occurred every few months thereafter, and frequency changes at the end
  of each year. The jumps increased in size to 100 ms. This UTC was intended to permit
  a very close approximation to UT2.[29]\nIn 1967, the SI second was redefined in
  terms of the frequency supplied by a caesium atomic clock. The length of second
  so defined was practically equal to the second of ephemeris time.[35] This was the
  frequency that had been provisionally used in TAI since 1958. It was soon recognised
  that having two types of second with different lengths, namely the UTC second and
  the SI second used in TAI, was a bad idea. It was thought that it would be better
  for time signals to maintain a consistent frequency, and that that frequency should
  match the SI second. Thus it would be necessary to rely on time steps alone to maintain
  the approximation of UT. This was tried experimentally in a service known as \"Stepped
  Atomic Time\" (SAT), which ticked at the same rate as TAI and used jumps of 200 ms
  to stay synchronised with UT2.[2]\nThere was also dissatisfaction with the frequent
  jumps in UTC (and SAT). In 1968, Louis Essen, the inventor of the caesium atomic
  clock, and G. M. R. Winkler both independently proposed that steps should be of
  1 s only.[36] This system was eventually approved, along with the idea of maintaining
  the UTC second equal to the TAI second. At the end of 1971, there was a final irregular
  jump of exactly 0.107758 TAI seconds, so that 1 January 1972 00:00:00 UTC was 1
  January 1972 00:00:10 TAI exactly, making the difference between UTC and TAI an
  integer number of seconds. At the same time, the tick rate of UTC was changed to
  exactly match TAI. UTC also started to track UT1 rather than UT2. Some time signals
  started to broadcast the DUT1 correction (UT1 − UTC) for applications requiring
  a closer approximation of UT1 than UTC now provided.[37][38]\nCurrent number of
  leap seconds\nThe first leap second occurred on 30 June 1972. Since then, leap seconds
  have occurred on average about once every 19 months, always on 30 June or 31 December.
  As of July 2015, there have been 26 leap seconds in total, all positive, putting
  UTC 36 seconds behind TAI.[39]\nRationale\n\n\n\n\nGraph showing the difference
  DUT1 between UT1 and UTC (in seconds). Vertical segments correspond to leap seconds.\n\n\nEarth's
  rotational speed is very slowly decreasing because of tidal deceleration; this increases
  the length of the mean solar day. The length of the SI second was calibrated on
  the basis of the second of ephemeris time[32][35] and can now be seen to have a
  relationship with the mean solar day observed between 1750 and 1892, analysed by
  Simon Newcomb. As a result, the SI second is close to 1/86400 of a mean solar day
  in the mid‑19th century.[40] In earlier centuries, the mean solar day was shorter
  than 86,400 SI seconds, and in more recent centuries it is longer than 86,400 seconds.
  Near the end of the 20th century, the length of the mean solar day (also known simply
  as \"length of day\" or \"LOD\") was approximately 86,400.0013 s.[41] For this reason,
  UT is now \"slower\" than TAI by the difference (or \"excess\" LOD) of 1.3 ms/day.\nThe
  excess of the LOD over the nominal 86,400 s accumulates over time, causing the UTC
  day, initially synchronised with the mean sun, to become desynchronised and run
  ahead of it. Near the end of the 20th century, with the LOD at 1.3 ms above the
  nominal value, UTC ran faster than UT by 1.3 ms per day, getting a second ahead
  roughly every 800 days. Thus, leap seconds were inserted at approximately this interval,
  retarding UTC to keep it synchronised in the long term.[42] The actual rotational
  period varies on unpredictable factors such as tectonic motion and has to be observed,
  rather than computed.\nJust as adding a leap day every four years does not mean
  the year is getting longer by one day every four years, the insertion of a leap
  second every 800 days does not indicate that the mean solar day is getting longer
  by a second every 800 days. It will take approximately 50,000 years for a mean solar
  day to lengthen by one second (at a rate of 2 ms/cy, where cy means century). This
  rate fluctuates within the range of 1.7–2.3 ms/cy. While the rate due to tidal friction
  alone is about 2.3 ms/cy, the uplift of Canada and Scandinavia by several metres
  since the last Ice Age has temporarily reduced this to 1.7 ms/cy over the last 2,700 years.[43]
  The correct reason for leap seconds, then, is not the current difference between
  actual and nominal LOD, but rather the accumulation of this difference over a period
  of time: Near the end of the 20th century, this difference was about 1/800 of a
  second per day; therefore, after about 800 days, it accumulated to 1 second (and
  a leap second was then added).\nIn the graph of DUT1 above, the excess of LOD above
  the nominal 86,400 s corresponds to the downward slope of the graph between vertical
  segments. (The slope became shallower in the 2000s (decade), because of a slight
  acceleration of Earth's crust temporarily shortening the day.) Vertical position
  on the graph corresponds to the accumulation of this difference over time, and the
  vertical segments correspond to leap seconds introduced to match this accumulated
  difference. Leap seconds are timed to keep DUT1 within the vertical range depicted
  by this graph. The frequency of leap seconds therefore corresponds to the slope
  of the diagonal graph segments, and thus to the excess LOD.\nFuture\nSee also: Leap
  second\nAs the Earth's rotation continues to slow, positive leap seconds are required
  more frequently. The long-term rate of change of LOD is approximately +1.7 ms per
  century. At the end of the 21st century, LOD will be roughly 86,400.004 s, requiring
  leap seconds every 250 days. Over several centuries, the frequency of leap seconds
  will become problematic.\nSome time in the 22nd century, two leap seconds will be
  required every year. The current use of only the leap second opportunities in June
  and December will be insufficient, and the March and September options will have
  to be used. In the 25th century, four leap seconds will be required every year,
  so the current quarterly options will be insufficient. Thereafter there will need
  to be the possibility of leap seconds at the end of any month. In about two thousand
  years, even that will be insufficient, and there will have to be leap seconds that
  are not at the end of a month.[44] In a few tens of thousands of years (the timing
  is uncertain), LOD will exceed 86,401 s, causing UTC to require more than one leap
  second per day.\nIn April 2001, Rob Seaman of the National Optical Astronomy Observatory
  proposed that leap seconds be allowed to be added monthly rather than twice yearly.[45]\nThere
  is a proposal to redefine UTC and abolish leap seconds, such that sundials would
  slowly get further out of sync with civil time.[46] The resulting gradual shift
  of the sun's movements relative to civil time is analogous to the shift of seasons
  relative to the yearly calendar that results from the calendar year not precisely
  matching the tropical year length. This would be a major practical change in civil
  timekeeping, but would take effect slowly over several centuries. UTC (and TAI)
  would be more and more ahead of UT; it would coincide with local mean time along
  a meridian drifting slowly eastward (reaching Paris and beyond).[47] Thus, the time
  system would lose its fixed connection to the geographic coordinates based on the
  IERS meridian. The difference between UTC and UT could reach 0.5 hour after the
  year 2600 and 6.5 hours around 4600.[44]\nITU‑R Study Group 7 and Working Party 7A
  were unable to reach consensus on whether to advance the proposal to the 2012 Radiocommunications
  Assembly; the chairman of Study Group 7 elected to advance the question to the 2012
  Radiocommunications Assembly (20 January 2012),[48] but consideration of the proposal
  was postponed by the ITU until the World Radio Conference in 2015, convening on
  2 November.[49]\nThe possibility of suppressing the leap second was considered in
  November 2015 at the World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-15), which is the
  international regulatory body which defines Coordinated Universal Time.[50] No decision
  to suppress leap seconds was reached; the issue will be studied further and reconsidered
  in 2023.[51]\nSee also\nEphemeris time\nIERS Reference Meridian\nISO 8601\nMars

  /* @nomin */\n} );Coordinated Universal Time (French: temps universel coordonné),
  abbreviated as UTC, is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks
  and time. It is, within about 1 second, mean solar time at 0° longitude;[1] it does
  not observe daylight saving time. It is one of several closely related successors
  to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). For most purposes, UTC is considered interchangeable
  with GMT, but GMT is no longer precisely defined by the scientific community.UTC
  was officially formalized in 1960 by the International Radio Consultative Committee
  in Recommendation 374,[2] having been initiated by several national time laboratories.
  The system was adjusted several times until leap seconds were adopted in 1972 to
  simplify future adjustments. A number of proposals have been made to replace UTC
  with a new system that would eliminate leap seconds but no consensus has yet been
  reached.The current version of UTC is defined by International Telecommunications
  Union Recommendation (ITU-R TF.460-6), Standard-frequency and time-signal emissions[3]
  and is based on International Atomic Time (TAI) with leap seconds added at irregular
  intervals to compensate for the slowing of Earth's rotation.[4] Leap seconds are
  inserted as necessary to keep UTC within 0.9 second of universal time, UT1.[5] See
  the \"Current number of leap seconds\" section for the number of leap seconds inserted
  to date.The official abbreviation for Coordinated Universal Time is UTC. This abbreviation
  arose from a desire by the International Telecommunication Union and the International
  Astronomical Union to use the same abbreviation in all languages. English speakers
  originally proposed CUT (for \"coordinated universal time\"), while French speakers
  proposed TUC (for \"temps universel coordonné\"). The compromise that emerged was
  UTC,[8] which conforms to the pattern for the abbreviations of the variants of Universal
  Time (UT0, UT1, UT2, UT1R, etc.).[9]Time zones around the world are expressed using
  positive or negative offsets from UTC, as in the list of time zones by UTC offset.The
  westernmost time zone uses UTC−12, being twelve hours behind UTC; the easternmost
  time zone, theoretically, uses UTC+12, being twelve hours ahead of UTC. In 1995,
  the island nation of Kiribati moved those of its atolls in the Line Islands from
  UTC-10 to UTC+14 so that the country would all be on the same day.UTC is used in
  many Internet and World Wide Web standards. The Network Time Protocol, designed
  to synchronise the clocks of computers over the Internet, encodes times using the
  UTC system.[10] Computer servers, online services and other entities that rely on
  having a universally accepted time use UTC as it is more specific than GMT. If only
  limited precision is needed, clients can obtain the current UTC from a number of
  official Internet UTC servers. For sub-microsecond precision, clients can obtain
  the time from satellite signals.UTC is also the time standard used in aviation,[11]
  e.g. for flight plans and air traffic control clearances. Weather forecasts and
  maps all use UTC to avoid confusion about time zones and daylight saving time. The
  International Space Station also uses UTC as a time standard.Amateur radio operators
  often schedule their radio contacts in UTC, because transmissions on some frequencies
  can be picked up by many timezones.[12]UTC is also used in digital tachographs used
  on large goods vehicles (LGV) under EU and AETR rules.UTC divides time into days,
  hours, minutes and seconds. Days are conventionally identified using the Gregorian
  calendar, but Julian day numbers can also be used. Each day contains 24 hours and
  each hour contains 60 minutes. The number of seconds in a minute is usually 60,
  but with an occasional leap second, it may be 61 or 59 instead.[13] Thus, in the
  UTC time scale, the second and all smaller time units (millisecond, microsecond,
  etc.) are of constant duration, but the minute and all larger time units (hour,
  day, week, etc.) are of variable duration. Decisions to introduce a leap second
  are announced at least six months in advance in \"Bulletin C\" produced by the International
  Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service.[14][15] The leap seconds cannot be
  predicted far in advance due to the unpredictable rate of rotation of the Earth.[16]Nearly
  all UTC days contain exactly 86,400 SI seconds, with exactly 60 seconds in each
  minute. However, because the mean solar day is slightly longer than 86,400 SI seconds,
  occasionally the last minute of a UTC day is adjusted to have 61 seconds. The extra
  second is called a leap second. It accounts for the grand total of the extra length
  (about 2 milliseconds each) of all the mean solar days since the previous leap second.
  The last minute of a UTC day is permitted to contain 59 seconds to cover the remote
  possibility of the Earth rotating faster, but that has not yet been necessary. The
  irregular day lengths mean that fractional Julian days do not work properly with
  UTC.Since 1972, UTC is calculated by subtracting the accumulated leap seconds from
  International Atomic Time (TAI), which is a coordinate time scale tracking notional
  proper time on the rotating surface of the Earth (the geoid). In order to maintain
  a close approximation to UT1 (equivalent to GMT), UTC occasionally has discontinuities
  where it changes from one linear function of TAI to another. These discontinuities
  take the form of leap seconds implemented by a UTC day of irregular length. Discontinuities
  in UTC have occurred only at the end of June or December, although there is provision
  for them to happen at the end of March and September as well as a second preference.[17][18]
  The International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) tracks and
  publishes the difference between UTC and Universal Time, DUT1 = UT1 – UTC, and introduces
  discontinuities into UTC to keep DUT1 in the interval (−0.9 s, +0.9 s).As with TAI,
  UTC is only known with the highest precision in retrospect. Users who require an
  approximation in real time must obtain it from a time laboratory, which disseminates
  an approximation using techniques such as GPS or radio time signals. Such approximations
  are designated UTC(k), where k is an abbreviation for the time laboratory.[19] The
  time of events may be provisionally recorded against one of these approximations;
  later corrections may be applied using the International Bureau of Weights and Measures
  (BIPM) monthly publication of tables of differences between canonical TAI/UTC and
  TAI(k)/UTC(k) as estimated in real time by participating laboratories.[20] (See
  the article on International Atomic Time for details.)Because of time dilation,
  a standard clock not on the geoid, or in rapid motion, will not maintain synchronicity
  with UTC. Therefore, telemetry from clocks with a known relation to the geoid is
  used to provide UTC when required, on locations such as those of spacecraft.It is
  not possible to compute the exact time interval elapsed between two UTC timestamps
  without consulting a table that describes how many leap seconds occurred during
  that interval. Therefore, many scientific applications that require precise measurement
  of long (multi-year) intervals use TAI instead. TAI is also commonly used by systems
  that cannot handle leap seconds. GPS time always remains exactly 19 seconds behind
  TAI (neither system is affected by the leap seconds introduced in UTC).For most
  common and legal-trade purposes, the fractional second difference between UTC and
  UT (GMT) is inconsequentially small. Greenwich Mean Time is the legal standard in
  Britain during the winter, and this notation is familiar to and used by the population.[21]Time
  zones are usually defined as differing from UTC by an integer number of hours,[22]
  although the laws of each jurisdiction would have to be consulted if sub-second
  accuracy was required. Several jurisdictions have established time zones that differ
  by an integer number of half-hours or quarter-hours from UT1 or UTC.Current civil
  time in a particular time zone can be determined by adding or subtracting the number
  of hours and minutes specified by the UTC offset, which ranges from UTC−12:00 in
  the west to UTC+14:00 in the east (see List of UTC time offsets).The time zone using
  UTC is sometimes denoted UTC±00:00 or by the letter Z — a reference to the equivalent
  nautical time zone (GMT), which has been denoted by a Z since about 1950. Time zones
  were identified by successive letters of the alphabet and the Greenwich time zone
  was marked by a Z as it was the point of origin. The letter also refers to the \"zone
  description\" of zero hours, which has been used since 1920 (see time zone history).
  Since the NATO phonetic alphabet word for Z is \"Zulu\", UTC is sometimes known
  as \"Zulu time\". This is especially true in aviation, where \"Zulu\" is the universal
  standard.[23] This ensures all pilots regardless of location are using the same
  24-hour clock, thus avoiding confusion when flying between time zones.[24] See the
  list of military time zones for letters used in addition to Z in qualifying time
  zones other than Greenwich.On electronic devices that only allow the current time
  zone to be configured using maps or city names, UTC can be selected indirectly by
  selecting Reykjavík, Iceland, which is always on UTC and does not use daylight saving
  time.[25]UTC does not change with a change of seasons, but local time or civil time
  may change if a time zone jurisdiction observes daylight saving time (summer time).
  For example, local time on the east coast of the United States is five hours behind
  UTC during winter, but four hours behind while daylight saving is observed there.[26]At
  the 1884 International Meridian Conference held in Washington, D.C., the local mean
  solar time at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in England was chosen to define the
  Universal day, counted from 0 hours at mean midnight. This agreed with civil Greenwich
  Mean Time (GMT), used on the island of Great Britain since 1847. In contrast, astronomical
  GMT began at mean noon, 12 hours after mean midnight of the same date until 1 January
  1925, whereas nautical GMT began at mean noon, 12 hours before mean midnight of
  the same date, at least until 1805 in the Royal Navy, but persisted much later elsewhere
  because it was mentioned at the 1884 conference. In 1884, the Greenwich Meridian
  was used for two-thirds of all charts and maps as their Prime Meridian.[27] In 1928,
  the term Universal Time (UT) was introduced by the International Astronomical Union
  to refer to GMT, with the day starting at midnight.[28] Until the 1950s, broadcast
  time signals were based on UT, and hence on the rotation of the Earth.In 1955, the
  caesium atomic clock was invented. This provided a form of timekeeping that was
  both more stable and more convenient than astronomical observations. In 1956, the
  U.S. National Bureau of Standards and U.S. Naval Observatory started to develop
  atomic frequency time scales; by 1959, these time scales were used in generating
  the WWV time signals, named for the shortwave radio station that broadcasts them.
  In 1960, the U.S. Naval Observatory, the Royal Greenwich Observatory, and the UK
  National Physical Laboratory coordinated their radio broadcasts so time steps and
  frequency changes were coordinated, and the resulting time scale was informally
  referred to as \"Coordinated Universal Time\".[29]In a controversial decision, the
  frequency of the signals was initially set to match the rate of UT, but then kept
  at the same frequency by the use of atomic clocks and deliberately allowed to drift
  away from UT. When the divergence grew significantly, the signal was phase shifted
  (stepped) by 20 ms to bring it back into agreement with UT. Twenty-nine such steps
  were used before 1960.[30]In 1958, data was published linking the frequency for
  the caesium transition, newly established, with the ephemeris second.[31] The ephemeris
  second is the duration of time that, when used as the independent variable in the
  laws of motion that govern the movement of the planets and moons in the solar system,
  causes the laws of motion to accurately predict the observed positions of solar
  system bodies. Within the limits of observing accuracy, ephemeris seconds are of
  constant length, as are atomic seconds. This publication allowed a value to be chosen
  for the length of the atomic second that would work properly with the celestial
  laws of motion.[32]In 1961 the Bureau International de l'Heure began coordinating
  the UTC process internationally (but the name Coordinated Universal Time was not
  adopted by the International Astronomical Union until 1967).[33][34] Time steps
  occurred every few months thereafter, and frequency changes at the end of each year.
  The jumps increased in size to 100 ms. This UTC was intended to permit a very close
  approximation to UT2.[29]In 1967, the SI second was redefined in terms of the frequency
  supplied by a caesium atomic clock. The length of second so defined was practically
  equal to the second of ephemeris time.[35] This was the frequency that had been
  provisionally used in TAI since 1958. It was soon recognised that having two types
  of second with different lengths, namely the UTC second and the SI second used in
  TAI, was a bad idea. It was thought that it would be better for time signals to
  maintain a consistent frequency, and that that frequency should match the SI second.
  Thus it would be necessary to rely on time steps alone to maintain the approximation
  of UT. This was tried experimentally in a service known as \"Stepped Atomic Time\"
  (SAT), which ticked at the same rate as TAI and used jumps of 200 ms to stay synchronised
  with UT2.[2]There was also dissatisfaction with the frequent jumps in UTC (and SAT).
  In 1968, Louis Essen, the inventor of the caesium atomic clock, and G. M. R. Winkler
  both independently proposed that steps should be of 1 s only.[36] This system was
  eventually approved, along with the idea of maintaining the UTC second equal to
  the TAI second. At the end of 1971, there was a final irregular jump of exactly
  0.107758 TAI seconds, so that 1 January 1972 00:00:00 UTC was 1 January 1972 00:00:10
  TAI exactly, making the difference between UTC and TAI an integer number of seconds.
  At the same time, the tick rate of UTC was changed to exactly match TAI. UTC also
  started to track UT1 rather than UT2. Some time signals started to broadcast the
  DUT1 correction (UT1 − UTC) for applications requiring a closer approximation of
  UT1 than UTC now provided.[37][38]The first leap second occurred on 30 June 1972.
  Since then, leap seconds have occurred on average about once every 19 months, always
  on 30 June or 31 December. As of July 2015, there have been 26 leap seconds in total,
  all positive, putting UTC 36 seconds behind TAI.[39]Earth's rotational speed is
  very slowly decreasing because of tidal deceleration; this increases the length
  of the mean solar day. The length of the SI second was calibrated on the basis of
  the second of ephemeris time[32][35] and can now be seen to have a relationship
  with the mean solar day observed between 1750 and 1892, analysed by Simon Newcomb.
  As a result, the SI second is close to 1/86400 of a mean solar day in the mid‑19th
  century.[40] In earlier centuries, the mean solar day was shorter than 86,400 SI
  seconds, and in more recent centuries it is longer than 86,400 seconds. Near the
  end of the 20th century, the length of the mean solar day (also known simply as
  \"length of day\" or \"LOD\") was approximately 86,400.0013 s.[41] For this reason,
  UT is now \"slower\" than TAI by the difference (or \"excess\" LOD) of 1.3 ms/day.The
  excess of the LOD over the nominal 86,400 s accumulates over time, causing the UTC
  day, initially synchronised with the mean sun, to become desynchronised and run
  ahead of it. Near the end of the 20th century, with the LOD at 1.3 ms above the
  nominal value, UTC ran faster than UT by 1.3 ms per day, getting a second ahead
  roughly every 800 days. Thus, leap seconds were inserted at approximately this interval,
  retarding UTC to keep it synchronised in the long term.[42] The actual rotational
  period varies on unpredictable factors such as tectonic motion and has to be observed,
  rather than computed.Just as adding a leap day every four years does not mean the
  year is getting longer by one day every four years, the insertion of a leap second
  every 800 days does not indicate that the mean solar day is getting longer by a
  second every 800 days. It will take approximately 50,000 years for a mean solar
  day to lengthen by one second (at a rate of 2 ms/cy, where cy means century). This
  rate fluctuates within the range of 1.7–2.3 ms/cy. While the rate due to tidal friction
  alone is about 2.3 ms/cy, the uplift of Canada and Scandinavia by several metres
  since the last Ice Age has temporarily reduced this to 1.7 ms/cy over the last 2,700 years.[43]
  The correct reason for leap seconds, then, is not the current difference between
  actual and nominal LOD, but rather the accumulation of this difference over a period
  of time: Near the end of the 20th century, this difference was about 1/800 of a
  second per day; therefore, after about 800 days, it accumulated to 1 second (and
  a leap second was then added).In the graph of DUT1 above, the excess of LOD above
  the nominal 86,400 s corresponds to the downward slope of the graph between vertical
  segments. (The slope became shallower in the 2000s (decade), because of a slight
  acceleration of Earth's crust temporarily shortening the day.) Vertical position
  on the graph corresponds to the accumulation of this difference over time, and the
  vertical segments correspond to leap seconds introduced to match this accumulated
  difference. Leap seconds are timed to keep DUT1 within the vertical range depicted
  by this graph. The frequency of leap seconds therefore corresponds to the slope
  of the diagonal graph segments, and thus to the excess LOD.As the Earth's rotation
  continues to slow, positive leap seconds are required more frequently. The long-term
  rate of change of LOD is approximately +1.7 ms per century. At the end of the 21st
  century, LOD will be roughly 86,400.004 s, requiring leap seconds every 250 days.
  Over several centuries, the frequency of leap seconds will become problematic.Some
  time in the 22nd century, two leap seconds will be required every year. The current
  use of only the leap second opportunities in June and December will be insufficient,
  and the March and September options will have to be used. In the 25th century, four
  leap seconds will be required every year, so the current quarterly options will
  be insufficient. Thereafter there will need to be the possibility of leap seconds
  at the end of any month. In about two thousand years, even that will be insufficient,
  and there will have to be leap seconds that are not at the end of a month.[44] In
  a few tens of thousands of years (the timing is uncertain), LOD will exceed 86,401 s,
  causing UTC to require more than one leap second per day.In April 2001, Rob Seaman
  of the National Optical Astronomy Observatory proposed that leap seconds be allowed
  to be added monthly rather than twice yearly.[45]There is a proposal to redefine
  UTC and abolish leap seconds, such that sundials would slowly get further out of
  sync with civil time.[46] The resulting gradual shift of the sun's movements relative
  to civil time is analogous to the shift of seasons relative to the yearly calendar
  that results from the calendar year not precisely matching the tropical year length.
  This would be a major practical change in civil timekeeping, but would take effect
  slowly over several centuries. UTC (and TAI) would be more and more ahead of UT;
  it would coincide with local mean time along a meridian drifting slowly eastward
  (reaching Paris and beyond).[47] Thus, the time system would lose its fixed connection
  to the geographic coordinates based on the IERS meridian. The difference between
  UTC and UT could reach 0.5 hour after the year 2600 and 6.5 hours around 4600.[44]ITU‑R
  Study Group 7 and Working Party 7A were unable to reach consensus on whether to
  advance the proposal to the 2012 Radiocommunications Assembly; the chairman of Study
  Group 7 elected to advance the question to the 2012 Radiocommunications Assembly
  (20 January 2012),[48] but consideration of the proposal was postponed by the ITU
  until the World Radio Conference in 2015, convening on 2 November.[49]The possibility
  of suppressing the leap second was considered in November 2015 at the World Radiocommunication
  Conference (WRC-15), which is the international regulatory body which defines Coordinated
  Universal Time.[50] No decision to suppress leap seconds was reached; the issue
  will be studied further and reconsidered in 2023.[51]"
