  In cryptography, plaintext is information a sender wishes to transmit to a receiver. Cleartext is often used as a synonym. Plaintext has reference to the operation of cryptographic algorithms, usually encryption algorithms, and is the input upon which they operate. Cleartext, by contrast, refers to data that is transmitted or stored unencrypted (that is, 'in the clear').

  Overview[edit]
- |
  Before the computer era, plaintext most commonly meant message text in the language of the communicating parties. Since computers became commonly available, the definition has expanded to include:
- |
  messages (for example, email messages)
- |
  document content such as word processor and spreadsheet files
- |
  audio and video files, digital photographs and any other multimedia
- |
  files containing other files such as Zip files or ISO images
- |
  ATM, credit card and other banking information
- |
  sensor data
- |
  any other data that a person wishes to keep private
- |
  Much of this data is not directly meaningful to humans, being already transformed into computer manipulable forms. While the original definition implied that the message could be read by a human being, the modern definition emphasizes that a person using a computer could easily interpret the data.
- |
  Any information which the communicating parties wish to conceal from others can now be treated, and referred to, as plaintext. Thus, in a significant sense, plaintext is the 'normal' representation of data before any action has been taken to conceal, compress, or 'digest' it. It need not represent text, and even if it does, the text may not be "plain".
- |
  Plaintext is used as input to an encryption algorithm; the output is usually termed ciphertext particularly when the algorithm is a cipher. Codetext is less often used, and almost always only when the algorithm involved is actually a code. In some systems, however, multiple layers of encryption are used, in which case the output of one encryption algorithm becomes plaintext input for the next.
- |
  Secure handling of plaintext[edit]
- |
  In a cryptosystem, weaknesses can be introduced through insecure handling of plaintext, allowing an attacker to bypass the cryptography altogether. Plaintext is vulnerable in use and in storage, whether in electronic or paper format. Physical security deals with methods of securing information and its storage media from local, physical, attacks. For instance, an attacker might enter a poorly secured building and attempt to open locked desk drawers or safes. An attacker can also engage in dumpster diving, and may be able to reconstruct shredded information if it is sufficiently valuable to be worth the effort. One countermeasure is to burn or thoroughly crosscut shred discarded printed plaintexts or storage media; NSA is infamous for its disposal security precautions.
- |
  If plaintext is stored in a computer file (and the situation of automatically made backup files generated during program execution must be included here, even if invisible to the user), the storage media along with the entire computer and its components must be secure. Sensitive data is sometimes processed on computers whose mass storage is removable, in which case physical security of the removed disk is separately vital. In the case of securing a computer, useful (as opposed to handwaving) security must be physical (e.g., against burglary, brazen removal under cover of supposed repair, installation of covert monitoring devices, etc.), as well as virtual (e.g., operating system modification, illicit network access, Trojan programs, ...). The wide availability of keydrives, which can plug into most modern computers and store large quantities of data, poses another severe security headache. A spy (perhaps posing as a cleaning person) could easily conceal one and even swallow it, if necessary.
- |
  Discarded computers, disk drives and media are also a potential source of plaintexts. Most operating systems do not actually erase anything — they simply mark the disk space occupied by a deleted file as 'available for use', and remove its entry from the file system directory. The information in a file deleted in this way remains fully present until overwritten at some later time when the operating system reuses the disk space. With even low-end computers commonly sold with many gigabytes of disk space and rising monthly, this 'later time' may be months later, or never. Even overwriting the portion of a disk surface occupied by a deleted file is insufficient in many cases. Peter Gutmann of the University of Auckland wrote a celebrated 1996 paper on the recovery of overwritten information from magnetic disks; areal storage densities have gotten much higher since then, so this sort of recovery is likely to be more difficult than it was when Gutmann wrote.
- |
  Also, independently, modern hard drives automatically remap sectors that are starting to fail; those sectors no longer in use will contain information that is entirely invisible to the file system (and all software which uses it for access to disk data), but is nonetheless still present on the physical drive platter. It may, of course, be sensitive plaintext. Some government agencies (e.g., NSA) require that all disk drives be physically pulverized when they are discarded, and in some cases, chemically treated with corrosives before or after. This practice is not widespread outside of the government, however. For example, Garfinkel and Shelat (2003) analyzed 158 second-hand hard drives acquired at garage sales and the like and found that less than 10% had been sufficiently sanitized. A wide variety of personal and confidential information was found readable from the others. See data remanence.
- |
  Laptop computers are a special problem. The US State Department, the British Secret Service, and the US Department of Defense have all had laptops containing secret information,some perhaps in plaintext form, 'vanish' in recent years. Announcements of similar losses are becoming a common item in news reports. Disk encryption techniques can provide protection against such loss or theft — if properly chosen and used.
- |
  On occasion, even when the data on the host systems is itself encrypted, the media used to transfer data between such systems is nevertheless plaintext due to poorly designed data policy. An incident in October 2007 in which HM Revenue and Customs lost CDs containing no less than the records of 25 million child benefit recipients in the United Kingdom — the data apparently being entirely unencrypted — is a case in point.
- |
  Modern cryptographic systems are designed to resist known plaintext or even chosen plaintext attacks and so may not be entirely compromised when plaintext is lost or stolen. Older systems used techniques such as padding and Russian copulation to obscure information in plaintext that could be easily guessed, and to resist the effects of loss of plaintext on the security of the cryptosystem.

  Web browser saved password security controversy[edit]
- |
  Several popular web browsers which offer to store a user's passwords do so in plaintext form. Even though most of them initially hide the saved passwords, it is possible for anyone to view all passwords in cleartext with a few clicks of the mouse, by going into the browsers' security settings options menus. In 2010, it emerged that this is the case with Firefox (still the case as of end-2014), and in Aug 2013 it emerged that Google Chrome does so as well.[1] When a software developer raised the issue with the Chrome security team,[2] a company representative responded that Google would not change the feature, and justified the refusal by saying that hiding the passwords would "provide users with a false sense of security" and "that's just not how we approach security on Chrome".[3]

  to:\t\t\t\t\tnavigation, \t\t\t\t\tsearch\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\tThis article is about
  cryptography.  For the computing term meaning the storage of textual material that
  is (largely) unformatted, see plain text.\n\n\n\nThis article needs additional citations
  for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable
  sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (June 2011)\nIn cryptography,
  plaintext is information a sender wishes to transmit to a receiver. Cleartext is
  often used as a synonym. Plaintext has reference to the operation of cryptographic
  algorithms, usually encryption algorithms, and is the input upon which they operate.
  Cleartext, by contrast, refers to data that is transmitted or stored unencrypted
  (that is, 'in the clear').\n\n\n\nContents\n\n1 Overview\n2 Secure handling of plaintext\n2.1
  Web browser saved password security controversy\n\n3 See also\n4 References\n\n\nOverview[edit]\nBefore
  the computer era, plaintext most commonly meant message text in the language of
  the communicating parties. Since computers became commonly available, the definition
  has expanded to include:\nmessages (for example, email messages)\ndocument content
  such as word processor and spreadsheet files\naudio and video files, digital photographs
  and any other multimedia\nfiles containing other files such as Zip files or ISO
  images\nATM, credit card and other banking information\nsensor data\nany other data
  that a person wishes to keep private\nMuch of this data is not directly meaningful
  to humans, being already transformed into computer manipulable forms. While the
  original definition implied that the message could be read by a human being, the
  modern definition emphasizes that a person using a computer could easily interpret
  the data.\nAny information which the communicating parties wish to conceal from
  others can now be treated, and referred to, as plaintext. Thus, in a significant
  sense, plaintext is the 'normal' representation of data before any action has been
  taken to conceal, compress, or 'digest' it. It need not represent text, and even
  if it does, the text may not be \"plain\".\nPlaintext is used as input to an encryption
  algorithm; the output is usually termed ciphertext particularly when the algorithm
  is a cipher. Codetext is less often used, and almost always only when the algorithm
  involved is actually a code. In some systems, however, multiple layers of encryption
  are used, in which case the output of one encryption algorithm becomes plaintext
  input for the next.\nSecure handling of plaintext[edit]\nIn a cryptosystem, weaknesses
  can be introduced through insecure handling of plaintext, allowing an attacker to
  bypass the cryptography altogether. Plaintext is vulnerable in use and in storage,
  whether in electronic or paper format. Physical security deals with methods of securing
  information and its storage media from local, physical, attacks. For instance, an
  attacker might enter a poorly secured building and attempt to open locked desk drawers
  or safes. An attacker can also engage in dumpster diving, and may be able to reconstruct
  shredded information if it is sufficiently valuable to be worth the effort. One
  countermeasure is to burn or thoroughly crosscut shred discarded printed plaintexts
  or storage media; NSA is infamous for its disposal security precautions.\nIf plaintext
  is stored in a computer file (and the situation of automatically made backup files
  generated during program execution must be included here, even if invisible to the
  user), the storage media along with the entire computer and its components must
  be secure. Sensitive data is sometimes processed on computers whose mass storage
  is removable, in which case physical security of the removed disk is separately
  vital. In the case of securing a computer, useful (as opposed to handwaving) security
  must be physical (e.g., against burglary, brazen removal under cover of supposed
  repair, installation of covert monitoring devices, etc.), as well as virtual (e.g.,
  operating system modification, illicit network access, Trojan programs, ...). The
  wide availability of keydrives, which can plug into most modern computers and store
  large quantities of data, poses another severe security headache. A spy (perhaps
  posing as a cleaning person) could easily conceal one and even swallow it, if necessary.\nDiscarded
  computers, disk drives and media are also a potential source of plaintexts. Most
  operating systems do not actually erase anything — they simply mark the disk space
  occupied by a deleted file as 'available for use', and remove its entry from the
  file system directory. The information in a file deleted in this way remains fully
  present until overwritten at some later time when the operating system reuses the
  disk space. With even low-end computers commonly sold with many gigabytes of disk
  space and rising monthly, this 'later time' may be months later, or never. Even
  overwriting the portion of a disk surface occupied by a deleted file is insufficient
  in many cases. Peter Gutmann of the University of Auckland wrote a celebrated 1996
  paper on the recovery of overwritten information from magnetic disks; areal storage
  densities have gotten much higher since then, so this sort of recovery is likely
  to be more difficult than it was when Gutmann wrote.\nAlso, independently, modern
  hard drives automatically remap sectors that are starting to fail; those sectors
  no longer in use will contain information that is entirely invisible to the file
  system (and all software which uses it for access to disk data), but is nonetheless
  still present on the physical drive platter. It may, of course, be sensitive plaintext.
  Some government agencies (e.g., NSA) require that all disk drives be physically

  For example, Garfinkel and Shelat (2003) analyzed 158 second-hand hard drives acquired

  popular web browsers which offer to store a user's passwords do so in plaintext
  form. Even though most of them initially hide the saved passwords, it is possible
  for anyone to view all passwords in cleartext with a few clicks of the mouse, by
  going into the browsers' security settings options menus. In 2010, it emerged that
  this is the case with Firefox (still the case as of end-2014), and in Aug 2013 it
  emerged that Google Chrome does so as well.[1] When a software developer raised
  the issue with the Chrome security team,[2] a company representative responded that
  Google would not change the feature, and justified the refusal by saying that hiding
  the passwords would \"provide users with a false sense of security\" and \"that's
  just not how we approach security on Chrome\".[3]\nSee also[edit]\nRed/black concept\nLightweight

  /* @nomin */\n} );In cryptography, plaintext is information a sender wishes to transmit
  to a receiver. Cleartext is often used as a synonym. Plaintext has reference to
  the operation of cryptographic algorithms, usually encryption algorithms, and is
  the input upon which they operate. Cleartext, by contrast, refers to data that is
  transmitted or stored unencrypted (that is, 'in the clear').Before the computer
  era, plaintext most commonly meant message text in the language of the communicating
  parties. Since computers became commonly available, the definition has expanded
  to include:Much of this data is not directly meaningful to humans, being already
  transformed into computer manipulable forms. While the original definition implied
  that the message could be read by a human being, the modern definition emphasizes
  that a person using a computer could easily interpret the data.Any information which
  the communicating parties wish to conceal from others can now be treated, and referred
  to, as plaintext. Thus, in a significant sense, plaintext is the 'normal' representation
  of data before any action has been taken to conceal, compress, or 'digest' it. It
  need not represent text, and even if it does, the text may not be \"plain\".Plaintext
  is used as input to an encryption algorithm; the output is usually termed ciphertext
  particularly when the algorithm is a cipher. Codetext is less often used, and almost
  always only when the algorithm involved is actually a code. In some systems, however,
  multiple layers of encryption are used, in which case the output of one encryption
  algorithm becomes plaintext input for the next.In a cryptosystem, weaknesses can
  be introduced through insecure handling of plaintext, allowing an attacker to bypass
  the cryptography altogether. Plaintext is vulnerable in use and in storage, whether
  in electronic or paper format. Physical security deals with methods of securing
  information and its storage media from local, physical, attacks. For instance, an
  attacker might enter a poorly secured building and attempt to open locked desk drawers
  or safes. An attacker can also engage in dumpster diving, and may be able to reconstruct
  shredded information if it is sufficiently valuable to be worth the effort. One
  countermeasure is to burn or thoroughly crosscut shred discarded printed plaintexts
  or storage media; NSA is infamous for its disposal security precautions.If plaintext
  is stored in a computer file (and the situation of automatically made backup files
  generated during program execution must be included here, even if invisible to the
  user), the storage media along with the entire computer and its components must
  be secure. Sensitive data is sometimes processed on computers whose mass storage
  is removable, in which case physical security of the removed disk is separately
  vital. In the case of securing a computer, useful (as opposed to handwaving) security
  must be physical (e.g., against burglary, brazen removal under cover of supposed
  repair, installation of covert monitoring devices, etc.), as well as virtual (e.g.,
  operating system modification, illicit network access, Trojan programs, ...). The
  wide availability of keydrives, which can plug into most modern computers and store
  large quantities of data, poses another severe security headache. A spy (perhaps
  posing as a cleaning person) could easily conceal one and even swallow it, if necessary.Discarded
  computers, disk drives and media are also a potential source of plaintexts. Most
  operating systems do not actually erase anything — they simply mark the disk space
  occupied by a deleted file as 'available for use', and remove its entry from the
  file system directory. The information in a file deleted in this way remains fully
  present until overwritten at some later time when the operating system reuses the
  disk space. With even low-end computers commonly sold with many gigabytes of disk
  space and rising monthly, this 'later time' may be months later, or never. Even
  overwriting the portion of a disk surface occupied by a deleted file is insufficient
  in many cases. Peter Gutmann of the University of Auckland wrote a celebrated 1996
  paper on the recovery of overwritten information from magnetic disks; areal storage
  densities have gotten much higher since then, so this sort of recovery is likely
  to be more difficult than it was when Gutmann wrote.Also, independently, modern
  hard drives automatically remap sectors that are starting to fail; those sectors
  no longer in use will contain information that is entirely invisible to the file
  system (and all software which uses it for access to disk data), but is nonetheless
  still present on the physical drive platter. It may, of course, be sensitive plaintext.
  Some government agencies (e.g., NSA) require that all disk drives be physically
  pulverized when they are discarded, and in some cases, chemically treated with corrosives
  before or after. This practice is not widespread outside of the government, however.
  For example, Garfinkel and Shelat (2003) analyzed 158 second-hand hard drives acquired
  at garage sales and the like and found that less than 10% had been sufficiently
  sanitized. A wide variety of personal and confidential information was found readable
  from the others. See data remanence.Laptop computers are a special problem. The
